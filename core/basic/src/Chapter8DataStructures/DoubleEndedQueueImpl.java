/*
A double-ended queue (dequeue or deque) is an abstract data type that generalizes a queue, for which elements can be added to or removed from either the front or rear. Deque differs from the queue abstract data type or First-In-First-Out List (FIFO), where elements can only be added to one end and removed from the other. This general data class has some possible sub-types:

        1) An input-restricted deque is one where deletion can be made from both ends, but insertion can be made at one end only.
        2) An output-restricted deque is one where insertion can be made at both ends, but deletion can be made from one end only.

        Insertion Sort

        You can use Deque as a stack by making insertion and deletion at the same side. Also you can use Deque as queue by making insetting elements at one end and removing elements at other end.

        The common way of deque implementations are by using dynamic array or doubly linked list. Here this example shows the basic implementation of deque using a list, which is basically a dynamic array.

        The complexity of Deque operations is O(1), when we not consider overhead of allocation/deallocation of dynamic array size.
