//    In the above program the class FirstJavaProgram has public access and hence declared public.
//        ‘class’ is the keyword used to create a class.
//        For running stand-alone programs ‘main’ method is needed which has a signature similar to the one defined in the above program.
//        ‘Main’ method takes an array of strings as an argument. The name of the array can be anything.
//        To display the output, pass the string as an argument to the method System.out.println.
