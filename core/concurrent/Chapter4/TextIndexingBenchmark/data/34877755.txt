==Production== Laila in Kanda Naal Mudhal. The film was expected to be shot and released by May 2010 but eventually failed to proceed so swiftly.  

The film re-emerged in October 2011 where it was announced that the lead roles were being played by Aari of Rettaisuzhi fame and winner of Miss South India 2010, Shubha Phutela; while production was taken over by Mayuri Sekar. The actress had to learn Tamil, and it took her over two months of practice to get the pronunciation right. The director wanted to opt for live-sound recording, making it more difficult for the non-Tamil speaking actress.  Shubha Phutela had to opt out of the Kannada film in February 2012, Jai Bhajarong Bali, choosing to give her priority dates to completing Maalai Pozhudhin Mayakathilaey. However, she expired on October 2012 due to kidney problems.  Aari mentioned that it was "really challenging to play an ordinary guy", as he had to consciously keep his emotions to a minimum at all times.

==Reception==
Maalai Pozhudhin Mayakathilaey received negative reviews. A reviewer from Sify.com wrote that it was "back breakingly long and turns out to be a boring affair", continuing to quote that the director had "tried out an experimental film which is preachy, monotonous and moves at snail pace".  The Times of India critic M. Suganth called it a "largely uninteresting — and also a little pretentious — film that fails in execution, the chief culprit being the pacing".  Behindwoods.com rated it 1.5/5, noting that it was "the weak script and slow pace of the movie that hampers the progress". The reviewer further criticized the "documentary feel throughout the film", the characterization as well as the "philosophical lines and preachy dialogues".  Indiaglitz.com, too, found fault at the films pace, although the background score by Achu and the cinematography by Gopi Amarnath were applauded.  Rohit Ramachandran of Nowrunning.com rated it 1.5/5 concluding: "An eventful day in a coffee shop that turns into an uninteresting love-life seminar". 

At last it is considered as forgettable film of the year.
