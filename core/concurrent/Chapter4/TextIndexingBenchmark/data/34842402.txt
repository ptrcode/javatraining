No One But Me is a 2012 documentary film about Scottish jazz musician Annie Ross, directed by Brian Ross and produced by Gill Parry. Filmed over three years, the film focuses upon Ross musical career, struggles with heroin addiction, and her relationships with both her family and contemporaries, Billie Holiday and Lenny Bruce. Regarding the film, Ross noted, "Its very blunt, its very truthful.   It makes me a bit nervous, but one thing about the film – it’s honest." 
 Peter King, James Wormworth, Tony Kinsey and Warren Vache.

==Release== 2012 Glasgow Film Festival to a sell-out performance,  with Ross attending its premier and participating in a Q&A session and concert,  following its screening. 

==Reception== The Herald stated, "This BBC Scotland/Creative Scotland-backed documentary is much more than a TV talking heads effort," and praised its "cinematic style that uses beautifully photographed cutaway shots to atmospherically evoke locations as diverse as the car-choked streets of New York and the free-flowing burns of Fintry."
