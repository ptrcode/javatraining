 1943 war film starring Randolph Scott. The story is based on the real-life World War II Makin Island raid led by Lieutenant Colonel Evans Carlsons 2nd Marine Raider Battalion.

==Plot== Sergeant "Transport" Lieutenant Colonel Thorwald (Randolph Scott) who he has served with in the China Marines. Thorwald explains that he left the Corps to serve with the Chinese guerrillas fighting the Japanese during the Second Sino-Japanese War to learn their methods and has decided to form a unit using the qualities of Gung Ho or "work together".

 rubber boats. The Marine landing is met by fire from snipers hiding in palm trees.  The Marines dispose of them, attack the Japanese headquarters, wipe out the Japanese garrison, destroy installations with explosives, then board the submarines for their return home.

==Production== Victor "Transport" Maghakian who served in the raid and survived the war.  Though many incidents in the film did not occur in the real Makin Island raid, Carlson wrote of his being pleased with the film to Wanger.  

Like many other films about the United States Marine Corps, the movie was filmed at Marine Corps Recruit Depot San Diego and  Camp Pendleton with Marine extras and technical advisors including Carlson, Maghakian, and Lt Wilfred Sylvio LeFrancois with all three men being awarded the Navy Cross  on the actual raid. The Japanese were played by Chinese and Filipino extras. 

==Themes==
The fast moving film is a template for many war films and other adventure or western films where a group of professional killers and misfits in polite society are handpicked by an inspiring leader, trained to perfection, then use their initiative and skills in marksmanship, combatives, and knife fighting on an enemy who greatly outnumber them.

Thorwald/Carlson lectures throughout the film that the Japanese have no initiative and can not think for themselves or deviate from a plan; thus unexpected action pays off. This is demonstrated in several scenes in the film where a Marine defeats his opponent in unarmed combat by spitting tobacco in his opponents eyes, a small but fast runner strips down to his trousers and quickly zig zag runs through enemy fire to deliver hand grenades, Marines destroy a Japanese pillbox and its occupants by squashing both with a road construction steamroller, and a speechless Robert Mitchum who has been shot in the throat and is unable to give warning kills a Japanese infiltrator attempting to kill the battalion surgeon (Milburn Stone) by throwing his knife in the Japanese soldiers back.  The climax of the film has the Raiders painting a giant American flag on the roof of a building, then luring the counterattacking Japanese to the area where their own air force bombs and strafes them.

In contrast to the Japanese and the rest of the American military, Thorwald orders that his officers wear no rank insignia and have no special privileges.  He tells his Raiders "I will eat what you eat and sleep where you sleep" and participate in the same training. Thorwalds Marines participate in "Gung Ho Sessions" where they discuss the units plans and each man participates without regard to rank.

==Reception==
Bosley Crowther in a January 1944 review for The New York Times praised the film, its performances and settings but said "the stabbings and stickings go on    Gung Ho! is for folks with strong stomachs and a taste for the submachine gun". 
===Box Office===
The movie was a big hit and earned profits of $577,460. 

It recorded admissions in France of 748,212 when released there in 1945.  
===Re-issue===
The film was re-released in the early 1950s by Realart Pictures who gave Robert Mitchum second billing on the posters.

The film has often been shown to recruits and Marines of the United States Marine Corps.

==Influences on popular culture==
The phrase Gung Ho entered the public lexicon from the film and the accounts of the actual Raiders.

In the early 1960s Louis Marx and Company came out with a "Gung Ho Commando Outfit" for children. 

Many individuals who accuse the U.S. Marine Corps of deliberately recruiting murderers and criminals may have been inspired by Rod Camerons role in the film.
