 Ministry of Information in 1940. It was directed by Brian Desmond Hurst and starred Mary Clare and Martita Hunt as two sisters, Caroline and Edith Grant, who have to deal with two invading Germans who arrive at their cottage. The film addressed the threat of invasion, and was intended to inspire confidence and convey the message Keep your heads.

==Plot== air raid warning.  When a man in uniform collapses outside their cottage, they bring him into their home and lay him down on their sofa. When he dies, they realise that the man is a German parachutist and, hearing the church bells tolling to warn of invasion, Caroline takes his revolver from him. 

Soon afterwards, a British army officer arrives asking for a map to help him find his unit. In reality, however, this is a German spy, who is exposed when mis-pronouncing Jarvis Cross as Yarvis Cross. Caroline turns the dead parachutists revolver on him and guards him, while sending Edith to seek assistance from the Air Raid Precautions|ARP. When Edith informs the ARP warden of the situation, he calls the Local Defence Volunteers (Home Guard), interrupting a lecture on German parachutists. 

The film returns to the Grants cottage, where the spy engineers his escape from Caroline by asking her for a cigarette. While she finds one, he knocks the gun out of her hands and flees the cottage. His flight is short-lived, however, because the Grants have immobilised their car and locked up their spare bicycle. He is thus apprehended by the LDV, who also destroy a parachute weapons canister. The final scene depicts the Grants thanking a member of the LDV over a cup of tea in their cottage, and he commends their actions with the words: You kept your heads. The front line is in every home nowadays.

==Production and background== Ministry of Information. Citizens were to follow the example of the Grants and immobilise their vehicles, keep maps locked away and refuse to give geographical information to strangers.  The Grants also keep the spy talking, which exposes him as a German.  The LDVs concluding words to the Grants, You kept your heads, also reflected advice given to citizens in Ministry of Information leaflets.

The film was produced quickly, which was necessary if its content was to be relevant. It was completed on 2 July and released on 5 August 1940.  Nevertheless, by the time of its release, there were already errors in it: The LDV had been renamed the Home Guard and the threat of invasion was receding.

==Reception==
Overall, the film was a success and well-liked for its drama.  However, the film was less well received in terms of its instructional element. Reviewers highlighted the fact that the film was flawed in terms of the advice it offered because most of us have no revolvers and in the event of invasion, they could not rely on dead Germans to supply them.  Some members of the War Office considered the film too frightening.
