 public radio show of the same name. The film received mostly positive reviews and was a moderate box office success on its small budget.

==Plot==
A long-running live radio show is in danger of being canceled by new owners of the company that holds both radio station "WLT" and the theater where the show is broadcast. The film takes place on the night of the shows last performance. The show has two visitors: an angel calling herself Asphodel (Virginia Madsen) comes to comfort the people who work on the show and to escort one of them to the afterlife, while "the Axeman" (Tommy Lee Jones), a representative of the new owners, arrives to judge whether the show should be canceled. He makes it clear that the show is not what he considers modern popular programming, and though he too is escorted by the angel, the show is shut down anyway. In an epilogue at the end of the film the former cast members are reunited at Mickeys Diner. Their conversation pauses as they are joined by Asphodel.

==Production notes== North Country, starring Charlize Theron and Harrelson) to be filmed in Minnesota in 2005.

Because the Fitzgerald is a rather small building, other stage theaters in the Minneapolis-St. Paul region had been considered as stand-ins. With some effort, the necessary film equipment was crammed into the structure. The basement was also used for sets due to lack of space. Set design had to make the show more visually interesting, and fake dressing rooms were used in the film (the movies production designer noted that Keillors actual dressing room is "about the size of a very, very small bathroom"). Mickeys Diner, a downtown St. Paul landmark, is also featured.
 Picturehouse bought the rights, and company president Bob Berney, "aiming to capitalize on the name recognition of the 31-year-old radio program, recommended that the title revert to A Prairie Home Companion. At the screening, Garrison said that to broaden the films appeal, they were thinking about changing the name to Savage Love, so we may have an argument there, Berney said."

==Reception==

===Critics===
A Prairie Home Companion opened the 2006 South by Southwest film festival on March 10, then premiered in St. Paul, Minnesota|St. Paul, on May 3, 2006, at the Fitzgerald Theater, which had projection and sound equipment brought in for that purpose.

Michael Medved gave the film one and a half stars out of four, saying, "The entertainment value stands somewhere between thin and nonexistent" and "  the worst movie ever made that pooled the talents of four (count ‘em – four!) Oscar winners". 

Desson Thomson from The Washington Post fell in between, saying in a review headlined "Honey, You Could Ask for More" (a reference to the theme song of the radio show and film) that while the movie had its strengths, it was weaker than it should have been.
