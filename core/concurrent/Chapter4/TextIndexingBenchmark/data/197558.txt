}} Pixar Animation Studios, and released by Walt Disney Pictures. John Lasseter and Andrew Stanton both were the executive producers. The film was co-directed by Lee Unkrich and David Silverman and stars the voices of John Goodman, Billy Crystal, Steve Buscemi, James Coburn and Jennifer Tilly.

The film centers on two monsters employed at the titular Monsters, Inc. — top scarer James P. "Sulley" Sullivan (John Goodman) and his one-eyed partner and best friend Mike Wazowski (Billy Crystal). Monsters, Inc. employees generate their citys power by targeting and scaring children, but they are themselves afraid that the children may contaminate them; when one child enters Monstropolis, Mike and Sulley must return her.

Docter began developing the film in 1996 and wrote the story with Jill Culton, Jeff Pidgeon, and Ralph Eggleston. Fellow Pixar director Andrew Stanton wrote the screenplay with screenwriter Daniel Gerson. The characters went through many incarnations over the films five-year production process. The technical team and animators found new ways to render fur and cloth realistically for the film. Randy Newman, who composed the music for Pixars three prior films, returned to compose its fourth.
 3D re-release in theaters on December 19, 2012. Its prequel, Monsters University, directed by Dan Scanlon, was released on June 21, 2013.

==Plot== parallel city of Monstropolis is inhabited by monsters and powered by the screams of children in the human world. At the factory of Monsters, Inc., employees called "scarers" venture into childrens bedrooms to scare them and collect their screams, using closet doors as portals. This is considered a dangerous task because the monsters believe children are toxic and that touching them would be fatal. However, production is falling as children are becoming harder to scare and the companys chairman Henry J. Waternoose III is determined to find a solution. The top scarer is James P. "Sulley" Sullivan, who lives with his friend and assistant Mike Wazowski and has a rivalry with the ever-determined chameleon-like monster Randall Boggs. During an ordinary days work on what is known as  the "Scarefloor", another scarer accidentally brings a childs sock into the factory, causing the Child Detection Agency (CDA) to arrive and cleanse him. Mike is constantly harassed by the companys clerk Roz for never completing his paperwork on time.

While working late at the factory, Sulley discovers that Randall left an activated door on the scarefloor and a young girl (voiced by Mary Gibbs) has entered the factory, much to Sulleys horror. After a few failed attempts to put her back, he places her in his bag and hides when Randall arrives and returns the door to storage. Mike is at a restaurant on a date with his girlfriend Celia when Sulley comes over to him for help, but chaos erupts when the girl is discovered in the restaurant, and the CDA is called. Sulley and Mike escape the CDA and take the girl home, discovering that she isnt toxic after all. Sulley quickly grows attached to the girl and names her "Boo". The next day, they smuggle her into the factory and Mike attempts to return her through her door. Randall discovers that Boo is in the factory after seeing Mike in the newspaper with her. He tries to kidnap Boo, but instead kidnaps Mike by mistake.

In the basement, Randall reveals to Mike that he has built a torture machine ("Scream Extractor"), which would make the companys current tactics redundant. Randall straps Mike to the chair for experimentation, but Sulley stops Randall by unplugging the machine and reports Randall to Waternoose. However, Waternoose is revealed to be in allegiance with Randall and exiles Mike and Sulley to the Himalayas. The two are taken in by the Abominable Snowman, who tells them they can return to the factory through a nearby village. Sulley heads out, but Mike refuses to follow him out of frustration. Sulley returns to the factory and rescues Boo from the Scream Extractor. Mike returns to apologize to Sulley and inadvertently helps Sulley defeat Randall in a fight.

Randall pursues Mike and Sulley as they race through the factory and ride on the doors heading into storage, taking them into a giant vault where millions of closet doors are stored. Boos laughter activates the doors and allows the chase to pass in and out of the human world. After Boo stops Randall from pushing Sulley out of an open door, Sulley and Mike trap him in the human world using a door to a trailer park, where he is mistaken for an alligator and beaten up by a pair of hillbillies.

They are finally able to access Boos door, but Waternoose and the CDA send it back to the Scarefloor. Mike distracts the CDA, while Sulley escapes with Boo and her door while Waternoose follows. While arguing with Sulley, Waternoose reveals that he is working with Randall to kidnap kids and build the Scream Extractor in order to keep the company from going out of business and put an end to the energy crisis. The CDA appears after hearing Waternooses confession and arrest him. The CDAs leader is revealed to be Roz, who has been undercover for over two years trying to expose Waternooses plot and thanks them for the help. Sulley and Mike say goodbye to Boo and return her home; on Rozs orders Boos door is shredded. Sulley becomes the new chairman of Monsters Inc., and thanks to his experience with Boo, he comes up with a plan to end the companys energy crisis.

Months later, Sulleys leadership has changed the companys workload. The monsters now enter childrens bedrooms to make them laugh, since laughter is ten times more powerful than screams. Mike takes Sulley aside, revealing he has almost rebuilt Boos door, requiring only one more piece which Sulley took as a memento. Sulley enters and reunites with Boo.

==Voice cast==
 
* John Goodman as James P. "Sulley" Sullivan, a giant furry blue friendly and sweet monster with horns and purple spots. Even though he excels at scaring children, he is kindhearted and thoughtful by nature. Sulley has a relaxed, outgoing and happy personality. In the films beginning, he is "The Best Scarer" for several months running.
* Billy Crystal as Michael "Mike" Wazowski, a green monster with a ball-shaped body, a single big eyeball, and skinny arms and legs, who runs Sulleys station on the scare floor, and they are close friends and roommates. Mike has an outgoing personality and is dating Celia Mae. He has an ego that often makes him forget something obvious, such as how his face is obscured in advertisements for the company. He makes cameo appearances in Finding Nemo, Cars (film)|Cars, WALL-E, and Toy Story 3.
* Mary Gibbs as Mary "Boo", a 2-year-old human girl who is unafraid of any monster except Randall, who regularly scares her at night. She refers to Sulley as "Kitty". The book based on the film gives Boos "real" name as Mary Gibbs, the name of her voice actress. In the film, one of Boos drawings is covered with the name "Mary."
* Steve Buscemi as Randall Boggs, an impatient, multi-legged lizard-shaped monster with a chameleon-like ability to change skin color and blend in completely with his surroundings. He is Mike and Sulleys rival in scream collection.

==Production==

===Development===
 .]]
The idea for Monsters, Inc. was conceived in a lunch in 1994 attended by John Lasseter, Pete Docter, Andrew Stanton and Joe Ranft during the production of Toy Story. Price, p. 157  One of the ideas that came out of the brainstorming session was a film about monsters. "When we were making Toy Story", Docter said, "everybody came up to me and said Hey I totally believed that my toys came to life when I left the room. So when Disney asked us to do some more films, I wanted to tap into a child-like notion that was similar to that. I knew monsters were coming out of my closet when I was a kid. So I said Hey, lets do a film about monsters." Monsters Inc, 2002 DVD, commentary 
 Point Richmond. Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs—suggested the title Monsters, Inc., which stuck. Price, p. 197 

===Writing===
Docters initial concept for the film went through many changes, but he found the notion of monsters living in their own world to be an appealing and workable one.    His original idea featured a 30-year-old man dealing with monsters that he drew in a book as a child coming back to bother him as an adult. Each monster represented a fear he had, and conquering those fears caused the monsters eventually to disappear. 

After Docter scrapped the initial concept of a 30-year-old terrified of monsters, he decided on a buddy story between a monster and a child titled simply Monsters, in which the monster character of Sulley (known at this stage as Johnson) was an up-and-comer at his workplace, where the companys purpose was to scare children. Sulleys eventual sidekick, Mike Wazowski, had not yet been added.   Price, p. 196 

Between the years 1996 and 2000, the lead monster and child went through radical changes as the story evolved. As the story continued to develop, the child varied in age and gender. Ultimately, the story team decided that a girl would be the best counterpart for a furry, 8-foot co-star.  After a girl was settled upon, the character continued to undergo changes, at one point being from Ireland and at another time being an African-American character.  Originally the character of the little girl, known as Mary, became a fearless seven-year-old who has been toughened by years of teasing and pranks from four older brothers.  In stark contrast, Johnson is nervous about the possibility of losing his job after the boss at Monsters, Inc. announces a downsizing is on the way. He feels envious because another scarer, Ned (who later became Randall), is the companys top performer.  Through various drafts, Johnsons occupation went back-and-forth from being a scarer and from working in another area of the company such as a janitor or a refinery worker, until his final incarnation as the best scarer at Monsters, Inc.  Johnson was originally planned to have tentacles for feet; however, this caused many problems in early animation tests. The idea was later largely rejected, as it was thought that audience would be distracted by the tentacles. Early Tests. Commentary by Thomas Porter, Steve May and Michael Fong  .  Marys age also differed from draft to draft until the writers settled on the age of 3. "We found that the younger she was, the more dependent she was on Sulley," Docter said. 

Eventually Johnson was renamed Sullivan. The name was suggested by an animator who had attended Texas A&M University, inspired by one of Texas A&Ms historic icons, Lawrence Sullivan Ross, nicknamed "Sully" by students. Sullivan was also planned to wear glasses throughout the film. However, the creators found it a dangerous idea because the eyes were a perfectly readable and clear way of expressing a characters personality; thus, the idea was rejected. 
 Muppet performer.  Jeff Pidgeon and Jason Katz story-boarded a test in which Mike helps Sulley choose a tie for work, and Mike Wazowski soon became a vital character in the film.  Originally, Mike had no arms and had to use his legs as appendages; however, due to technical difficulties, arms were soon added. 

Screenwriter Dan Gerson joined Pixar in 1999 and worked on the film for almost two years with the filmmakers on a daily basis. Gerson considered it his first experience writing a feature film. Dan Gerson explained, "I would sit with Pete and David Silverman and we would talk about a scene and they would tell me what they were looking for. I would make some suggestions and then go off and write the sequence. Wed get together again and review it and then hand it off to a story artist. Heres where the collaborative process really kicked in. The board artist was not beholden to my work and could take liberties here and there. Sometimes I would suggest an idea about making the joke work better visually. Once the scene moved on to animation, the animators would plus the material even further." 

===Casting===
The voice role of James P. "Sulley" Sullivan went to John Goodman, the longtime co-star of the comedy series Roseanne and a regular in the films of the Coen brothers. Goodman interpreted the character to himself as the monster equivalent of a National Football League player. "Hes like a seasoned lineman in the tenth year of his career," he said at the time. "He is totally dedicated and a total pro." Price, p. 198  Billy Crystal, having regretted turning down the part of Buzz Lightyear years prior, accepted that of Mike Wazowski, Sulleys one-eyed best friend and scare assistant.       The casting of Steve Buscemi as Randall, the rival of Sulley, saw a reunion between himself and John Goodman; they had previously worked together on The Big Lebowski and Barton Fink.

===Animation===
 
In November 2000, early in the production of Monsters, Inc., Pixar packed up and moved for the second time since its Lucasfilm years.  The companys approximately 500 employees had become spread among three buildings, separated by a busy highway. The company moved from Point Richmond to a much bigger campus, co-designed by Lasseter and Steve Jobs, in Emeryville, California|Emeryville. 

In production, Monsters Inc. differed from earlier Pixar features in that each main character had its own lead animator: John Kahrs on Sulley, Andrew Gordon on Mike, and Dave DeVan on Boo. Price, p. 199  Kahrs found that the "bearlike quality" of Goodmans voice provided an exceptionally good fit with the character. He faced a difficult challenge, however, in dealing with Sulleys sheer mass; traditionally, animators conveyed a figures heaviness by giving it a slower, more belabored movement, but Kahrs was concerned that such an approach to a central character would give the film a sluggish feel.  Like Goodman, Kahrs came to think of Sulley as a football player, one whose athleticism enabled him to move quickly in spite of his size. To help the animators with Sulley and other large monsters, Pixar arranged for Rodger Kram, a University of California, Berkeley expert on the locomotion of heavy mammals, to lecture on the subject. 

Adding to Sulleys lifelike appearance was an intense effort by the technical team to refine the rendering of fur. Other production houses had tackled realistic fur, most notably Rhythm & Hues in its 1993 polar bear commercials for Coca-Cola and in its talking animals faces in Babe (film)|Babe (1995).  Monsters, Inc., however, required fur on a far larger scale. From the standpoint of Pixars engineers, the quest for fur posed several significant challenges. One was figuring out how to animate the huge numbers of hairs—2,320,413 on Sulley—in a reasonably efficient way.  Another was making sure the hairs cast shadows on other hairs. Without self-shadowing, fur or hair takes on an unrealistic flat-colored look. (The hair on Andys toddler sister, as seen in the opening sequence of Toy Story, is an example of hair without self-shadowing.) 

The first fur test had Sullivan run an obstacle course. Results were not satisfactory, as objects would catch the fur and stretch it out because of the extreme amount of motion. Another similar test was also unsuccessful, with the fur going through the objects. 

Eventually Pixar set up a Simulation department and created a new fur simulation program called Fizt (for "physics tool").  After a shot with Sulley had been animated, the Simulation department took the data for the shot and added his fur. Fizt allowed the fur to react in a natural way. When Sulley moved, the fur would automatically react to his movements, taking into account the effects of wind and gravity as well. The Fizt program also controlled movement on Boos clothing, which provided another breakthrough. Price, p. 200  The deceptively simple-sounding task of animating cloth was also a challenge to animate because of the hundreds of creases and wrinkles that automatically occurred in the clothing when the wearer moved. 2002, Monsters Inc, DVD-Behind the Scenes  It also meant solving the complex problem of how to keep cloth untangled—that is, how to keep it from passing through itself when parts of it intersect. Price, p. 201  Fizt applied the same system to Boos clothes as to Sulleys fur. Boo would first be animated shirtless; the Simulation department then used Fizt to apply the shirt over Boos body, and when she moved, her clothes would react to her movements in a natural manner.

To solve the problem of cloth-to-cloth collisions, Michael Kass, Pixars senior scientist, was joined on Monsters, Inc. by David Baraff and Andrew Witkin and developed an algorithm they called "global intersection analysis" to handle the problem. The complexity of the shots in Monsters, Inc. — including elaborate sets such as the door vault — required more computing power to render than any of Pixars earlier efforts combined. The render farm in place for Monsters, Inc. was made up of 3500 Sun Microsystems processors, compared with 1400 for Toy Story 2 and only 200 for Toy Story. 

==Release== For the Birds.     As in A Bugs Life and Toy Story 2, a montage of "outtakes" and a performance of the company play were made and included in the end credits of the film sometime later. After the success of the 3D re-release of The Lion King,  Disney and Pixar re-released Monsters, Inc. in 3D on December 19, 2012. 

Monsters Inc. was released on VHS and DVD on September 17, 2002,  on Blu-ray on November 10, 2009,  and on Blu-ray 3D on February 19, 2013.

Charles Taylor from   gave a positive review, praising the films use of "creative energy": "There hasnt been a film in years to use creative energy as efficiently as Monsters, Inc."  Although Mike Clark from USA Today thought the comedy was sometimes "more frenetic than inspired and viewer emotions are rarely touched to any notable degree," he thought the film to be as "visually inventive as its Pixar predecessors." 

ReelViews film critic James Berardinelli, who gave the film 3  stars out of 4 wrote, saying that Monsters, Inc. was "one of those rare family films that parents can enjoy (rather than endure) along with their kids."  Roger Ebert, film critic from Chicago Sun-Times, who gave the film 3 out of 4 stars, called the film "cheerful, high-energy fun, and like the other Pixar movies, has a running supply of gags and references aimed at grownups."  Lisa Schwarzbaum, a film critic for Entertainment Weekly, giving the film a B, praised the films animation, stating "Everything from Pixar Animation Studios, the snazzy, cutting-edge computer animation outfit, looks really, really terrific, and unspools with a liberated, heppest-moms-and-dads-on-the-block iconoclasm."

==Lawsuits==
 s "Excuse My Dust", a film that he had tried to sell to Hollywood in 1998 ]]
Shortly before the films release, Pixar was sued by childrens song writer Lori Madrid of Wyoming, stating that the company had stolen her ideas from her 1997 poem "Theres a Boy in My Closet."

Madrid mailed her poem to six publishers in October 1999, notably Chronicle Books, before turning it into a local stage musical in August 2001. After seeing the trailer for Monsters, Inc., Madrid concluded that Chronicle Books had passed her work to Pixar and that the film was based on her work.  In October 2001, she filed the suit against Chronicle Books, Pixar, and Disney in a federal court in Cheyenne, Wyoming. Her lawyer asked the court to issue a preliminary injunction, that would forbid Pixar and Disney from releasing the film while the suit was pending.

In a hearing on November 1, 2001 — the day before the films scheduled release on 5,800 screens in 3,200 theaters across the country — the judge refused to issue the injunction. On June 26, 2002, he ruled that the film had nothing in common with the poem. 

In November 2002, Stanley Mouse filed a lawsuit, in which he alleged that the characters of Mike and Sulley were based on drawings of Excuse My Dust, a film that he had tried to sell to Hollywood in 1998.  The lawsuit also stated that a story artist from Pixar visited Mouse in 2000, and discussed Mouses work with him.    A Disney spokeswoman responded, by saying that the characters in Monsters, Inc. were "developed independently by the Pixar and Walt Disney Pictures creative teams, and do not infringe on anyones copyrights".    The case was ultimately settled under undisclosed terms. 

==Prequel==
 
A prequel, titled Monsters University, was released on June 21, 2013. John Goodman, Billy Crystal, and Steve Buscemi reprised their roles of Sulley, Mike, and Randall, while Dan Scanlon directed the film. The prequels plot focuses on Sulley and Mikes studies at Monsters University, where they start off as rivals but soon become best friends.
