 time machine to pursue Jack the Ripper into the 20th century.

==Plot== time machine David Warner), leads them to conclude that Stevenson might be the infamous killer. Wells races to his laboratory, but the time machine is gone. 
 socialist utopia, only to find chaos in the form of airplanes, automobiles and a worldwide history of war, crime and bloodshed.
 liberated employee Amy Robbins (Mary Steenburgen), who says she had directed Stevenson to the Hyatt Regency hotel.

Confronted by his one-time friend Herbert, Stevenson confesses that he finds modern society to be pleasingly   emergency room and mistakenly gets the impression that Stevenson has died from his injuries.

Herbert meets up with Amy Robbins again and she initiates a romance.  Stevenson returns to the bank to exchange more money.  Suspecting  that it was Amy who had led Herbert to him, he finds out where she lives.  Herbert, hoping to convince her of the truth, takes a highly skeptical Amy three days into the future.  Once there, she is aghast to see a newspaper headline revealing her own murder as the Rippers fifth victim.

Herbert persuades her that they must go back – it is their duty to attempt to prevent the fourth victims murder, then prevent Amys.  However, they are delayed upon their return to the present and can do no more than phone the police. Stevenson kills again, and Herbert is arrested because of his knowledge of the killing. Amy is left alone, totally defenseless, and at the mercy of the "San Francisco Ripper."

While Herbert unsuccessfully tries to convince the police of Amys peril, she attempts to hide from Stevenson. When the police finally do investigate her apartment, they find the dismembered body of a woman.  The police release a broken-hearted Wells.  However, he is contacted by Stevenson, who has actually killed Amys coworker and taken Amy hostage in order to extort the time machine key from Wells.

Stevenson flees with the key – and Amy as insurance – to attempt a permanent escape in the time machine. While Herbert bargains for Amys life, she is able to escape. As Stevenson starts up the time machine, Herbert removes the "vaporizing equalizer" from it.  As Herbert had explained earlier, this causes the machine to remain in place while its passenger is sent travelling endlessly through time, with no way to stop; in effect he is destroyed.
 the two later married.

 Southeast London accent, which McDowell felt would have resulted in unintentional humor if McDowell tried to mimic it for the film. McDowell abandoned any attempt to recreate Wellss authentic speaking style and preferred a more dignified speaking style.

==Critical reception==
In her review in The New York Times, Janet Maslin said the film "is every bit as magical as the trick around which it revolves." She continued, "Mr. Meyer isnt a particularly skilled director; this is his first attempt, and on occasion its very clumsy. But as a whizkid hes gone straight to the head of the class, with a movie thats as sweet as it is clever, and never so clever that it forgets to be entertaining. The satisfactions Time After Time offers are perhaps no more sophisticated than the fun one might have with an intricate set of electric trains. Still, fun of this sort isnt always easy to come by, not after ones age has climbed up into two digits. Theres a lot to be said for an adults movie with the shimmer of a childs new toy." 

Variety (magazine)|Variety termed it "a delightful, entertaining trifle of a film that shows both the possibilities and limitations of taking liberties with literature and history. Nicholas Meyer has deftly juxtaposed Victorian England and contemporary America in a clever story, irresistible due to the competence of its cast."
