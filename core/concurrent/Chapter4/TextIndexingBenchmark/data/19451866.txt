Nouvelle Vague (English: New Wave) is a 1990 French film written and directed by Jean-Luc Godard. It follows the story of hitchiker Lennox (Alain Delon) credited as "Lui" ("Him"), taken in by a wealthy industrialist, Elena Torlato-Favrini or "Elle" ("Her"), played by Domiziana Giordano. The film was entered into the 1990 Cannes Film Festival.   

==Plot==
La Contessa Elena Torlato-Favrini (her last name taken from The Barefoot Contessa) is a wealthy Italian industrialist living in a sprawling estate near Lake Geneva, Switzerland. She is attended by Jules the Gardener, his wife Yvonne, their daughter Cécile, the chauffeur Laurent, and the mysterious Della Larue (or "Della Street," a reference to Erle Stanley Gardners Perry Mason stories). At the films opening, Elena goes for a drive by herself and encounters Roger Lennox (his last name taken from The Long Goodbye), an apparent drifter. Elenas trajectory is brought to an abrupt halt as she stops to help Roger, who has evidently been forced off the road by a truck and is severely incapacitated. As Elena reaches out to take Rogers hand (the "miracle of empty hands"), their relationship begins.

The narrative continues with Roger now Elenas kept man. He dotes on her and is obedient to her retinue that includes Elenas lawyer Raoul Dorfman, Raouls girlfriend, the Doctor (one of Elenas shareholders), and the Doctors wife Dorothy Parker, a writer like her Dorothy_Parker|namesake. After a series of episodes in which both members of the couple express dissatisfaction with the other, and together ruminate on regret, Elena decides to take a boat across the lake to visit some friends. Roger obediently rows the boat, and stops when Elena wants to get in the water, but refuses to join her, citing inability to swim. In a mishap evocative of their first meeting, Roger falls into the water as Elena gets back into the boat. This time, Elena does not help, appearing indifferent to or even unaware of Rogers plight.

The servants and Raoul quickly attempt to cover up any existence of Roger but almost immediately there is a new crisis: a man identical to Roger, calling himself Richard Lennox and claiming to be Rogers brother, appears. He claims to know about the boating incident and is apparently using that as leverage to take over one of Elenas companies. Where before the figure of Lennox was passive and docile, he is now shrewd and aggressive; it is Elena that now becomes pliant.

The power struggle reaches a climax in a recapitulation of the boating scene. This time, it is Lennox that decides to take the boat out, and it is Elena that falls into the water, apparently unable to swim. Richard, at first as indifferent to Elena as she was to Roger Lennox in the same situation, abruptly takes Elenas hand and saves her. In the end, an equilibrium is reached. Elena realizes that Richard Lennox is the same man as Roger Lennox ("the same, but different"). Richard has taken on a controlling role in Elenas affairs but Elena remains in charge. With renewed vigor, Elena warmly bids arrivederci to her servants (Richard having earlier arranged to sell the estate for a large sum of money), and Elena and Richard in turn drive away, apparently off to have more adventures as equals.

==Background==
Most of the dialogue in the film consists of quotations from various sources, mostly literary.  The chauffeur periodically asks the Lennox character "was you ever bit by a dead bee?" – a reference to the Bogart and Bacall film To Have and Have Not. Though Godards previous films had been peppered with quotation and allusion, this is his first film where the dialogue is almost entirely quotation, a practice that he has continued in films such as Film Socialisme and Adieu au Langage. This is also the first film of many in which Godard takes the soundtrack music from the catalogue of ECM Records, whereas in the 80s he made extensive use of classical music. ECM has in turn released a   to the film from beginning to end, including the films music, dialogue, and ambient sounds.

==Themes==
Godard has said that the film is an allegory of the history of film. Elena represents the film industry. In the first half Lennox represents film and its makers that are taken in hand by the industry and nurtured but allowed to perish, or almost perish. Film is reborn in the figure of the French New Wave ("La Nouvelle Vague"), the filmmakers of which arrived armed with knowledge of the history of film but shrewd enough to manipulate the industry for their own ends, thus saving the industry from its own demise. Godard scholars like David Sterritt, Kaja Silverman, and Harun Farocki have identified other themes in the film.

==Reception== Hail Mary and the other sublime movies." Kaja Silverman and Harun Farocki likewise devote an entire chapter to the film in their Speaking About Godard. Based on 6 reviews, Nouvelle Vague has an approval rating of 67% on review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes. {{cite web
