== Cast ==
* Ali Cobrin as Kylie Atkins
* Adam DiMarco as Ben Stanley  Slaine as Loverboy
* James Thomas as Gary Preston

== Production == The Shrine.  After realizing that he had not seen themes of pornography and privacy explored in a slasher film, he recruited Gordon to write the script.  The story was always important to Mathews, and he said that he was very enthused with the project when he read Gordons script.   Though it was his first film, Matthews said that his experiences with previous productions had been collaborative enough that it seemed like a natural step for him.   Jon Knautz initially co-directed the film, but Knautz got an offer to direct another project.  Matthews encouraged him to take the opportunity and finished directing the film himself.   Matthews was influenced by Halloween (1978 film)|Halloween and used that films structure as a guide.  He said that the film serves as a cautionary tale about over-sharing on social media.   Slaine said that the mask he wore was very uncomfortable, and it could only be put on or taken off with help.  As a result, the mask had to stay on for extended periods during shooting.  Slaine attempted to channel events from his own life into his performance to heighten the emotional impact and make his character more sympathetic.  Cobrin said that she experienced some trepidation about her role, but her fondness for slasher films made it easier.   Shooting took place in Kanata, Ontario.

Rotten Tomatoes, a review aggregator, reports that 67% of nine surveyed critics gave the film a positive review; the average rating is 5.3/10.

Maitland McDonagh of Film Journal International wrote, "College girls earning some extra cash working for a porn site are targeted by a psycho killer in this formulaic but slickly executed thriller that should entertain undemanding genre buffs."   Michael Gingold of Fangoria rated it 2/4 stars and wrote of the films satiric content, "Too often, though, the moviemakers fall back on grisly, gamy sensationalism."   Pat Torfe of Bloody Disgusting rated it 3.5/5 stars and wrote, "Boasting some strong acting from almost everyone involved, coupled with a scary antagonist and some genuinely brutal moments that gorehounds will love, Girl House is definitely one of the stronger slasher films Ive recently seen."   Scott Hallam of Dread Central rated it 3.5/5 stars and wrote, "For a directorial debut, Trevor Matthews does a fantastic job. The movie is slick looking, nicely paced, and keeps the audienceâ€™s attention at all times."
