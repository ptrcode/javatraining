==Plot==
Police Lt. Leonard Diamond is on a personal crusade to bring down sadistic gangster Mr. Brown. Hes also dangerously obsessed with Browns girlfriend, the suicidal Susan Lowell.  His main objective as a detective is to uncover what happened to a woman called "Alicia" from the crime bosss past.

Mr. Brown, his second-in-command McClure and thugs Fante and Mingo kidnap and torture the lieutenant, then pour a bottle of alcohol-based hair tonic down his throat before letting him go. Diamond eventually learns through one of Browns past accomplices that Alicia was actually Browns wife. The accomplice suspects that Alicia was sent away to Sicily with former mob boss Grazzi, then murdered, tied to the boats anchor and permanently submerged.

Diamond questions a Swede named Dreyer, who was the skipper of that boat (but now operates an antiques store as a front, bankrolled by Brown).  Dreyer denies involvement, but this doesnt prevent him from being murdered by McClure within seconds after he leaves the shop.

Diamond tries to persuade Susan to leave Brown and admits he might be in love with her. He shows her a photo of Brown, Alicia and Grazzi together on the boat.  Susan finally confronts Brown about his wife and is told she is still alive in Sicily, Italy, living with Grazzi.

Brown next orders a hit on Diamond. However, when his gunmen Fante and Mingo go to Diamonds apartment, they mistakenly shoot and kill the cops burlesque dancer girlfriend Rita instead. Diamond sees an up-to-date photo of Alicia but realizes it wasnt taken in Sicily (since theres snow on the ground).  This leads Diamond to suspect Brown didnt kill Alicia but his boss Grazzi instead.  Diamond is able to track Alicia to a sanitarium, where she is staying under another name. He asks for her help.

Browns right-hand man, McClure, wants to take over. He plots with Fante and Mingo to ambush Mr. Brown, but ends up getting killed himself because they are loyal to the boss.

At police headquarters, Brown shows up with a writ of habeas corpus, effectively preventing Alicia to testify against her husband.  Brown also brings a big stash of "money" to Fante and Mingo while they are hiding out from the police, but the box turns out to contain a bomb that apparently kills both.

Brown shoots the lieutenants partner Sam and kidnaps Susan, planning to fly away to safety. Diamond finds a witness that could finally nail the elusive gangster—Mingo, who survived the blast and confesses that Brown was behind it all.  Alicia is able to help Diamond figure out where Brown was likely to take Susan, a private airport where Brown intends to board a getaway plane.

However, the plane doesnt show up and the film climaxes in a foggy airplane hangar shootout. Susan shines a bright light in Browns eyes and the lieutenant places him under arrest. The last scene shows the silhouetted figures of Diamond and Susan in the fog, considered to be one of the iconic images of film noir.

==Reception==
===Critical response===
 
Reviews of the movie today are mostly positive. Chris Dashiell on the website CineScene finds the dialogue "run of the mill" but praises the films director, writing that "Lewis had a remarkable ability to infuse poetry into the most banal material, and The Big Combo is one of his best efforts... its not as startlingly inventive as Lewiss best film, Gun Crazy (1949), but its a quality B-film, satisfying and dark." 

The staff at Variety (magazine)|Variety magazine liked the films direction, music and photography, despite "a rambling, not-too-credible plot."  They wrote, "Performances are in keeping with the bare-knuckle direction by Joseph Lewis and, on that score, are good. Low-key photography by John Alton and a noisy, jazzy score by David Raksin with solo piano by Jacob Gimpel are in keeping with the films tough mood." 

Film critic Ed Gonzalez lauded the film in his review, writing, "Shadows and lies are the stars of The Big Combo, a spellbinding black-and-white chiaroscuro with the segmented texture of a spiders web ... John Altons lush camera work is so dominant here you wouldnt know Joseph H. Lewis was also behind the camera. The story doesnt have any of the he-she psychosexual politicking that juices the directors Gun Crazy, but thats no loss given this films richer returns. The set-pieces are fierce, as is the Casablanca (film)|Casablanca tweak of the last shot, and Wallaces performance—a sad spectacle of a hurting creature caught between light and dark, good and evil—is one of noirs great unheralded triumphs." 

Critics have compared the quality of The Big Combo to Fritz Langs The Big Heat as one of the great film noir detective classics in terms of style.  It is also considered as one of the best work of legendary cinematographer John Alton. 

The review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reported that 91% of critics gave the film a positive review, based on eleven reviews. 

==In popular culture==
The twin brothers Fante and Mingo from the movie Serenity (movie)|Serenity were named after the similar duo in The Big Combo.

==Soundtrack==
Most film noir movies feature scores that are orchestral (strings). In contrast, The Big Combo is one of few that has a brass (trumpets, saxophones, etc.) score.
