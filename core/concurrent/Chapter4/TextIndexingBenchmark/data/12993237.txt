The films subject is the stadium culture of FC Basel supporters during a game (FC Basel vs FC ZÃ¼rich) in 2005 at the St. Jakob-Park and the importance of the chief supporter, Tobias Haufler, cheering on the crowd.
 SF were ARD even planned to broadcast the film during the 2006 FIFA World Cup in Germany.
