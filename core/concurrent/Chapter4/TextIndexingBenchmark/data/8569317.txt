==Title==
The films Hong Kong English language title is Righting Wrongs. The international version (dubbed in English) is titled Above the Law this title was also adopted for The Weinstein Companys 2007 US DVD release on their Dragon Dynasty label.

==Plot==
Jason Hsia Ling-chi (Biao) is a dedicated, by the books prosecutor who has tried to maintain patience and tolerance under the somewhat flimsy laws of the court. However, when his mentor is publicly gunned down in New Zealand and when the key witness of Has latest case and his entire family are wiped out over night, Ha can no longer go by the book.

Hsia initial plan is to take the law into his own hands and kill the two men he believes called for his witness murder. He is successful in killing the first, which causes the Hong Kong police department to wake up and take action to regain order. Enter Senior Inspector Cindy Si (Rothrock), who is put on the case to find the killer under her superior Sergeant Wong Jing-wai (Wong). However, when Hsia goes to kill the second defendant, Chow Ting-kwong (Tien), he is already dead. Unbeknownst to them, both of the defendants were working under an even higher power, known only as "Crown". However, it is soon discovered that "Crown" is none other than Sergeant Wong, who was also Chows killer.

Once Si realizes that Wong is the true mastermind behind all of the recent murders taking place, she and Ha finally work together to bring him in to prove he is not "above the law". However, depending on the version of the story told, both Si and Hsia fall victim to their ambition, with Si killed with a large screw through the neck by Wong and Hsia falling to his demise after killing Wong in an out of control airplane. However, in another version of the story, Si survives her attack from Wong, and while Hsia still kills Wong, he falls victim to a different, and rather ironic, fate: Hsia is given an eight-year sentence in prison under the charge of manslaughter (English dub), or a life sentence in prison under the charge of First Degree Murder (Mandarin dub).
