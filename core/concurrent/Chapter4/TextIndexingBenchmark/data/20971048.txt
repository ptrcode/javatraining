}} western film about a horse of the same name, directed by Nathan Juran and starring Audie Murphy,  Lori Nelson, Chill Wills, Roy Roberts, Russell Johnson, K.T. Stevens, Madge Meredith, and Lee Van Cleef. It was also known by the alternative title of Three Were Renegades.

==Plot==
Jim Harvey (Audie Murphy) is a guard on a wagon train. After he saves the life of a Yaqui Indian warrior, Tigre, the wagon train is attacked and Harvey realises their only chance of survival is if he can negotiate a truce with Tigres father, the chief Aguila (Ralph Moody). Aguila orders Harvey to be knocked out, and tortured later, but he is set free by Tigres mother. He goes to town and discovers the people on the wagon train were massacred, except for two sisters who Harvey insisted hide in the caves. Harvey is falsely accused of cowardice and the townsfolk threaten to lynch him.  Harvey escapes on a borrowed horse named Tumbleweed, and tries to prove his innocence, discovering that a white man was responsible for the attack.  It is the horses intelligence and instinct that save Harvey, and Murphys interaction with the horse, that drive much of the storyline.
