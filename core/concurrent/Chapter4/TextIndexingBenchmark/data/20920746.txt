==Production==
The idea of doing a Raymond Chandler-type story set on the Gold Coast came from Denny Lawrence. His original idea was to have an ex police officer working as a private investigator who investigated a quasi-religious commune run by a charlatan that ended with the deaths of many of the communes followers. Then the Jonestown Massacre happened and Lawrence backed away from this idea. Christine Cremen, "Denny Lawrence", Cinema Papers, Mayâ€“June 1983 p 113-115  

He then pitched the idea to Bob Ellis, who liked it and the two of them agreed to work together.   accesse 28 March 2015  They always envisioned Ray Barrett in the lead role as the private eye Stacey and the three of them got some money from the NSW Film Corporation to go up to Surfers Paradise for a week to research and write the script. 

Many of Ray Barretts characteristics found their way into the character of Stacey. Barrett:
 Bob is a great observer, and when I finally read the script, I thought "You bugger; youve observed Barrett!" But I didnt mind. I was flattered because Stacey is a living person. He is a failure, really, but a loveable failure; a kind man at heart. Yet everythings slipped by him and he hasnt achieved the things hes wanted to. The character relates to a lot of people, including myself. Bobs put the finger on it. Hes brilliant. Mark Stiles, "Ray Barrett", Cinema Papers, October 1982 p439  
According to Lawrence, he was more interested in a genre piece whereas Ellis tried to incorporate his personal politics, but the collaboration was a successful one and the two men would work again many times in the following years.  

The NSW Film Commission wanted Michael Thornhill to direct but he wanted several changes to the script and Ellis and Lawrence insisted that Carl Schultz direct.  The movie was shot in the winter of 1981 in and around Surfers Paradise over eight weeks. 

The character of Quiney was meant to be played by Anthony Quayle but Guy Doleman was cast instead. 

==Awards== AFI Awards, won in the Best Actor in the Lead Role (Ray Barrett) and Best Screenplay, Original or Adapted (Bob Ellis, Denny Lawrence) categories. John Seale won the Cinematographer of the Year award of the Australian Cinematographers Society. 

==Sequel==
Bob Ellis and Denny Lawrence wrote a sequel for the film called Goodbye Adelaide. The plot involved Stacy finishing the book he is writing in the first movie and visiting the Adelaide Festival to promote it, where he is caught up in an attempted defection by a Russian. However, the movie was never made. David Stratton, The Avacado Plantation, Pan Macmillan 1990 p 234-236
