Sell Out! is a 2008 comedy film set in Malaysia which premiered at the 65th Venice International Film Festival where it also won the Young Cinema Award for Alternative Vision. It was written, edited and directed by Yeo Joon Han who is a graduate of the London Film Academy. 

Described as Malaysia’s first Manglish (Malaysian-English) musical comedy, it points fingers at various institutions and people in the country, from bureaucrats and CEOs to artists and the media. 

== Plot ==
Self-absorbed Malaysian TV host, Rafflesia Pong (Jerrica Lai), whose art-discussion programme is dying from lousy ratings, stumbles upon a golden opportunity when her latest interviewee, an ex-boyfriend, dies in front of the camera. It is perfect timing as she has to find a way to come up with the ultimate reality show to outdo her American-accented pan-Asian rival. Eric Tan (Peter Davis) is a mild-mannered, half-English corporate slave who, like Pong, works for the Fony Corporation. He labours to create the perfect Soyamaker Machine but is constantly assailed by unreasonable insults from his megalomaniacal CEO bosses and is in love with Pong.
