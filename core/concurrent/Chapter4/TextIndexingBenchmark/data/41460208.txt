Joan Lui (also known as Joan Lui - Ma un giorno nel paese arrivo io di lunedì) is a 1985 Italian musical film|musical-comedy film written, directed and starred by Adriano Celentano. It is the last of the four films written and directed by Celentano and it is also the last film starred by Claudia Mori.
 Mario and Vittorio Cecchi Gori and Celentano as the producers decided, after a month since the first release, to replace the original cut with another version, with a different editing and lasting 30 minutes less.      

The film generally received bad reviews. Morando Morandini referred to it as "an enormous music video based on visual shock, jam-packed with music, with some monumental sets and elaborate editing. A true festival of kitsch also on an ideological level".  According to Paolo Mereghetti the film, "a personal reading of Christianity in musicals", was "a personal delusion of omnipotence", "a mock-apocalyptic madness that is just able to list the worst clichés of indifference".
