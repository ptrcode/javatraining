Aristide and the Endless Revolution
 
Aristide and the Endless Revolution is a 2005 feature documentary directed and produced by Nicolas Rossier about former Haitian President Jean-Bertrand Aristide and the coup detat that ousted him from the country in 2004.  Rossier was the first media professional to get exclusive access to Aristide while in exile and the resultant interview is featured in the film, as well as interviews with many experts on Haiti, including U.S. Representative Maxine Waters, noted economist Jeffrey Sachs and Aristides lawyer Ira J. Kurzban.

==Background==
Jean-Bertrand Aristide won Haitis first democratic presidential election in 1990 but was overthrown and exiled the following year.  He was restored to his presidency in 1994 and won the next election in 2000 but 2004 brought another coup which removed Aristide from power once again.  Although he was and remains extremely popular with Haitian citizens, many critics and opponents of the man contend that his government was rife with corruption and ineffective at addressing the countrys severe economic woes.   2004 ouster remains highly contentious.  The film delves into the buildup of that event, as well as the history of Haitian independence and the rise of Aristide from poverty to presidency.  Rossier speaks with many prominent figures in and outside of Haiti, including American author and academic Noam Chomsky, actor and activist Danny Glover and  the Assistant Secretary of State for Western Hemisphere Affairs under President George W. Bush, Roger Noriega.
