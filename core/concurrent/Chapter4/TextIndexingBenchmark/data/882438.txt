==Plot==
In the closing days of World War II, Irishman Murphy (Peter OToole) is the sole survivor of the crew of a merchant ship, Mount Kyle, which has been sunk by a German U-boat, which then machine-gunned the survivors in the water. Murphy makes it ashore (to a missionary settlement on the Orinoco in Venezuela) where he is treated by a pacifist Quaker doctor, Dr Hayden (Siân Phillips).

When he discovers the U-boat is hiding further up river, under the cover of the jungle, he sets about obsessively plotting his revenge to sink it by any means, including using a surviving Grumman J2F Duck floatplane from the Mount Kyle. The floatplane had been recovered, the wounded pilot later being shot dead in his hospital bed by the U-boat captain, in order to preserve the secret of the subs location and, presumably, its action in shooting survivors in the water.
 crane owned by the friendly Frenchman Louis (Philippe Noiret). This also fails as the U-boat dives under him. However, the dived U-boat becomes stuck in a mud bank. Murphy uses the crane to recover an unexploded torpedo fired earlier from the U-boat and drops it on the trapped crew, killing them. Murphy is also killed, as the explosion from the torpedo causes the crane jib to pin him to the deck as the floating crane sinks to the river bed.

 Lawrence of Arabia I did myself. But after suffering a paralyzed hand, a bad back, broken ankle and countless knocks, I decided never again. It was stupid. Films employ stunt men. They can do these things far better than I. I refused to do any more stunts.   I thought, well, just one more time. So I talked myself into it. In Venezuela I even fly a seaplane. If you want to see a picture of sheer terror have a look at the shots of me when I first fly that seaplane." Photoplay Film Monthly, February 1971.  

The extensive flying scene involves lots of shots of the floatplane veering sharply to avoid buildings, the jungle and stalling. For that sequence a camera was strapped to the wing of the aircraft.    The director, Peter Yates, said he was particularly interested in "the way in which three people — Murphy, a doctor and a Frenchman left in the   of war — are really brought together by circumstance and how each character plays on the other and makes them do things that they wish they hadnt and things they sometimes feel proud of."  

Several of the sequences were extraordinarily photographed by Douglas Slocombe — particularly the scenes of Murphy piloting the floatplane and the visuals along the Orinoco River. Especially notable is a spectacular airborne shot of a flock of scarlet ibises in flight along the shore of the river during the closing credits.
 John Glen, was especially well done — most notable in Murphys piloting sequences.

Several Peace Corps volunteers serving in towns near the Orinoco River were recruited to play Nazi submariners. The volunteers donated their daily wages to the Venezuelan school districts or other organizations with whom they were working at the time. 

Filming began on 23 February 1970, at a number of locations including Venezuela, Pinewood Studios, Iver Heath and Twickenham Film Studios, Middlesex, England and was completed in Malta on 5 July.  Deeley described the shoot as the toughest of his career and it led to the breakup of his partnership with Peter Yates, with whom he had made several films. 

 
 Type IX USS Tilefish which had been sold to the Venezuelan Navy in 1960. The floating crane was a former World War II tank landing craft. The Grumman J2F Duck|OA-12 Duck  used in the film was restored and flown by Frank Tallman  and is on display at the National Museum of the United States Air Force at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton, Ohio.  In the original book, the aircraft was a Fairey Swordfish.

==Reception== The New York Daily News called the film a "... sluggish action spectacle." 

Groggy Dundee of Nothing is Written said, "Peter Yates makes Murphys War enjoyable. War movie fans get their moneys worth, with Yates mixing beautiful Venezuelan (visuals) with violent action. Yates mixes conventional set pieces, like the Germans violent shore raids, with more inventive fare, like Murphys haphazard plane rides."
