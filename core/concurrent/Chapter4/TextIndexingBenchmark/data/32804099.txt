Cinta Pertama (First Love) is a 2006 Indonesian film. Directed by horror-veteran Nayato Fio Nuala, it starred Bunga Citra Lestari, Ben Joshua, and Richard Kevin. The soundtrack album, Cinta Pertama, was well received.

== Production ==
Cinta Pertama was directed by Nayato Fio Nuala, whose previous directing experience was in horror (genre)|horror; Hanya Wanita notes that this was evident in some hospital scenes, which were dark and eerie.  The script was written by Titien Wattimena. 

Bunga Citra Lestari, a first time film actress but long-time sinetron (Indonesian soap opera) actress, was cast for the lead female role. To prepare, she trained with Eka Sitorus.  She found the happy scenes to be hardest to act, but was grateful for the workshops and discussions the cast had on set. 

Addie MS was chosen to provide the score,  with Lestari also providing the vocals for the soundtrack,  including the lead song "Sunny",  which was written by Dewiq. 

== Plot ==
Alya (Bunga Citra Lestari), a 20-year-old woman becomes engaged to Abi (Richard Kevin), a young businessman. The following day, Abi finds her unconscious, with blood dripping from her nose. Fearful that she has a life threatening illness, he rushes her to the hospital. As Alya lies in a coma, Abi finds her diary and reads that she still loves her high school sweetheart and first love, Sunny (Ben Joshua); the two were separated after high school when Sunny left Jakarta for university, without either of them confessing their feelings.

Upon reading his fianc√©es diary, Abi decides to search for Sunny and ask him to visit Alya. Sunny, who by that point is already married, agrees after his wife gives him permission. Upon seeing Alya, Sunnys feelings return, and he holds Alyas hand. She wakes up from her coma.

== Release and reception == R for remaja, the equivalent of a US PG-13. 

Hanya Wanita called Lestaris performance "touching",  writing that her emotional struggle showed clearly. The score was praised, with it and the cinematography being compared to other Asian romances.
