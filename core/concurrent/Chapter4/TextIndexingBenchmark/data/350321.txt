== Plot ==
  androids (or David Andrews) "Cherry 2000" android (Pamela Gidley), short circuits during sex while on the wet kitchen floor. He is told by a repairman that shes irreparable and offers gynoids of his making, but Sam declines. The repairman says finding a Cherry model will be difficult since she was a limited edition from "the time before" the wars that tore apart the country. To make matters tougher, the gynoid dealer says that Cherry 2000 parts were built in a defunct factory in the antebellum era, and the factory is in "Zone 7", a particularly dangerous, lawless area.

After removing the small optical disk with all the memory from the old unit, Treadwell searches for a replacement, enlisting Edith "E" Johnson (Melanie Griffith), a tough tracker who guides him into Zone 7. Standing in their way is Lester (Tim Thomerson), a wasteland overlord with deranged subordinates who advocates an askew moralism where Lester decides whats right and wrong and kills anyone who doesnt agree with that. Edith and Sam enter an underground reservoir occupied by Six-Finger Jake, an elderly tracker who raised and taught Edith. Jake, an aficionado of American history, has made up his cave to be like a 20th Century home, and through getting to know Sam, wonders what caused society to abandon healthy male-female relationships. Lesters men attack as Edith and Sam head out with Jake for the factory. Sam is hit on the head during the fight and wakes up in a 1950s-styled motel/village run by Lester. Sam is greeted by his ex, Elaine, who has changed her name to Ginger and is Lesters woman now; she informs him that everyone was killed in the fight except him. Lester and his men arrive, towing behind them Ediths Ford and confirming what Elaine/Ginger had said. Lester takes an instant liking to Sam and decides to induct him into the group. Sam, in order to survive this encounter, goes along with it until he witnesses the sadistic murder of a tracker that Lesters men had found passed out from heat stroke in Ediths Ford.
 Orion (which is a tongue in cheek nod toward the films production company, Orion Pictures). When he goes for a sucker-punch to the gut, the man goes down easily even though he towers over Sam. Sam sees that he has a knife in his back, thrown by Edith, who is not dead and has come to rescue him. They are rejoined with Jake. As they leave, Jake decides to create some distractions and meet up with them later but before he leaves he gives Edith the device holding the Cherry memory disk while Sam is creating a distraction by making gas bombs out of the vehicles and a gas tank in the villages beehive house. Jake had led Sam to believe the chip had been lost when they were forced to kill and leave behind the donkey carrying it. Amid the destruction, the bees attack Lester stinging him and creating a running joke throughout the rest of the film about the bee-stings on his face.

Edith, realizing Sam is a veteran of the earlier wars, begins to see him in a new light. She allows him to think that the Cherry memory disk was lost in the hopes he will give up the search and reciprocate her feelings. Sam takes a turn driving while Edith sleeps, but finds himself distracted by her and ends up getting the car in an accident. They both exit the car shaken but unhurt. When Sam touches Edith in an attempt to make sure she really is all right, he realizes the attraction theyre developing for each other, and they start to make out on the cars hood. Things really start heating up between them, but before anything happens, Edith accidentally activates the device that is holding Cherrys memory chip, which was on the back of her belt. She hands over the disc and he accuses her of lying to him. They dont have time to work this out because Lesters goons show up and attack them, forcing them to fight and then, after killing the goons, continue on to the robot factory. Edith has them go to a brothel/gas station owned by Snappy, a friend of Jakes, to fix up and borrow a light plane that he had. Its revealed that Snappy is in league with Lester since his one and only prostitute, Randa, has Lester for a frequent client. When Lester and his underlings find Edith and Sam, Six-Finger Jake is killed, shot in the back and then the head by Randa while Edith and Sam escape in the plane. Randa reveals where the two were going. Lester kills Randa for making a comment about his face, and he and his men chase after Edith and Sam

After Sam tells Edith that Randa killed Jake, he suggests that they turn around and go back, but Edith says shes determined to find the Cherry 2000 model so that her surrogate fathers death was not meaningless. As Edith brings the plane down for a landing in Zone 7, its revealed that the zone is actually dunes covering up casinos, that Zone 7 is actually the ruins of Las Vegas, now a ghost town, and the gynoid "factory" is actually a casino called "Pharaohs Casino" (most likely a spoof on the Luxor Las Vegas Casino). While searching the abandoned casino, Sam finds a duplicate Cherry 2000. He inserts the memory chip into this duplicate, and Cherry "wakes up" as if nothing had happened from when she shorted out. Cherry and Sam kiss, but Edith reminds him that she told him hurry up, and now Lesters gang has found them. They have a shootout with Lesters gang, and the two end up killing nearly all of his men; Cherry doesnt understand any of this and naively says she would rather watch "all this on television". Sam finds Lester on the roof where they came into the casino and shoots him, causing Lester to fall into the casino, presumably dead. After escaping in the plane, they find that the combined weight of Edith, Cherry and Sam prevents takeoff. Edith says her job is done and that she can take care of herself and will jump out so that they can leave. Sam rejects this idea but Edith jumps out anyway without him realizing it. After the plane lifts into the air, he notices that it is only he and Cherry in the plan and is forced to make a critical choice.

Cherry tells Sam she loves him, and then quietly sits back when he doesnt reply the same. Sam turns around the plane to help Edith, who has been trapped by the remainder of Lesters men behind a giant genie lamp and is fighting for her life, egged on by Lester who has managed to crawl out of the casino, bleeding and severely wounded. Sam asks Cherry to get him a Pepsi and she happily complies by climbing out of the plane and then acting confused when she sees there is no place to get one for him. Sam drives the plane nearby where Edith is and tells her to get on. When E protests that the whole point of coming to Zone 7 was for Cherry, Sam replies "shes a robot". Lester tries to stop them by throwing a grappling hook on the planes wheels; this proves fruitless as he just ends up dangling on the end of it and colliding into a giant female Pharaoh statue, which finally kills him. The last two henchmen ask Ginger what they should do now that Lesters dead, and she benignly replies, "Well, no sandwich for him" after which she hands one to Cherry (who opens it and says "Pretty") and gets one out for herself, peeling off the crusts so she can eat it. Edith and Sam then kiss as they fly into the sunset like in an old Western.

==Soundtrack==
 
Cherry 2000 is widely known for the original score composed by Basil Poledouris. The soundtrack album prepared for release at the time of the film was canceled due to the film being shelved for a few years instead of receiving a theatrical release. Later, Varèse Sarabande decided to make it the debut release in their CD Club. Originally sold by mail-order for US$20 and at only 1,500 copies, it became a highly valued collectible, one copy selling for $2,500 on eBay. However, for being such a touted collectors item, the packaging for this limited edition CD was riddled with typographical errors. The track list had the incorrect length printed for the last two tracks, and two tracks were missing from the track list entirely.

In 2004, Prometheus Records acquired the rights to the score and made it available in a double package with another Poledouris score, No Mans Land (1987 film)|No Mans Land. The Prometheus Records release was not a limited edition and, as well as rectifying the track listing, features an additional eight minutes of unreleased music; however, it sold poorly.
