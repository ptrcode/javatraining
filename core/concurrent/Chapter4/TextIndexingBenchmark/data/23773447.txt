}} British adventure film of the silent era. It was directed by George Loane Tucker and starred Henry Ainley, Jane Gail and Gerald Ames. It was based on the novel Rupert of Hentzau by Anthony Hope, the sequel to The Prisoner of Zenda. It tells the story of the journey of an Englishmen to Ruritania in Eastern Europe where he is forced to impersonate a King to thwart the plans of a villainous aristocrat Rupert of Hentzau. 

It was released in the United States in 1916, which sometimes leads to it being attributed to that year. It was later re-released in 1918 at the end of the First World War.
