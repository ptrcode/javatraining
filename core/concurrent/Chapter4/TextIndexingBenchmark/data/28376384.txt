==Reception==
Among modern reviews, AllMovie gave the film three stars out of five, referring to it as "a stylish and fast-paced entry into the Italian crime genre that hits all the right marks for genre fans." as well as noting "The one real defect of La Via Della Droga is that it lacks a human story element to get the viewer emotionally involved but Castellari makes up for that oversight by keeping the story taut and fast-paced."  Roberto Curti, author of Italian Crime Filmography, 1968-1980, compared the film Casterllaris The Big Racket, stating that unlike that film "the result is a cold, technically impeccable yet overindulgent formalist exercise in style" that contained a  "comic book-style script, populated by dull characters"
