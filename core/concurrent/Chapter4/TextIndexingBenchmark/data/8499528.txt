A loose adaptation of the 1983 novel The Life and Loves of a She-Devil by British writer Fay Weldon, She-Devil tells the story of Ruth Patchett, a dumpy, overweight housewife who exacts devilish revenge on her philandering husband after he leaves her and their children for glamorous, best-selling romance novelist Mary Fisher.
 ABC sitcom Evil Angels (1988).
 Best Actress - Motion Picture Musical or Comedy the following year.

==Plot==
Ruth Patchett (Roseanne Barr) is a frumpy, overweight housewife and mother, who desperately tries to please her attractive accountant husband Bob (Ed Begley, Jr.). After Bob meets romance novelist Mary Fisher (Meryl Streep) at a dinner party, they begin having an affair; Mary also hires him as her accountant. Though aware of the affair, Ruth initially lives in denial (believing it to be a fling which Bob will leave) and continues to take care of her two children, Nicolette (Elisebeth Peters) and Andy (Bryan Larkin), and doing other household chores. However, Ruth soon begins to feel ragged after trying to prepare for Bobs parents visit, culminating with Ruth finding Andrews dead gerbil in a casserole pot. After Ruth confronts him about his affair in front of his parents, Bob decides to pack up his things and leave Ruth with the kids, calling her a liability and telling her she is a bad mother, a lousy wife, a terrible cook, and has the appearance of a "she-devil." Now at her breaking point, Ruth vows to get revenge on both Bob and Mary. Ruth writes a list of Bobs four assets: his home, his family, his career, and his freedom, crossing off each one as it is destroyed.

With Bob away at Marys mansion by the sea and the kids at school, she sets the house on fire through numerous methods such as tossing two lit cigarettes into a waste basket, microwaving aerosol cans, and overloading an electrical outlet. Ruth takes the family dog, a framed photo of the Patchett family, and - significantly for Ruths plan of revenge - Bobs file on Marys finances before leaving as the house explodes in a massive fireball. Ruth then drops the children and dog off at Marys mansion to live with their father. After seeing in Marys file that Mary pays for her mother to live in an expensive nursing home, Ruth takes a job there under the pseudonym Vesta Rose, and forms friendships with Marys estranged mother, Mrs. Fisher (Sylvia Miles), and diminutive co-worker Nurse Hooper (Linda Hunt). As part of her plan, Ruth gets Marys mother thrown out of the home, and the latter moves in with her daughter, much to Marys chagrin.

Ruth later partners with Hooper to start the Vesta Rose Employment Agency, which helps downtrodden, socially rejected women find good jobs in exchange for them unwittingly helping Ruth in her quest for vengeance against Bob; one such example is Olivia Honey (Maria Pitillo), whom Bob hires as his secretary. Though Bob falls for Olivia at first sight, he fires her after she confesses her love for him; a heartbroken Olivia reveals to Ruth that Bob wires interest from his clients accounts into an offshore Swiss bank account. Both women break into Bobs firm to wire larger amounts of money from Bobs clients accounts into Bobs Swiss account, making his embezzlement more visible to his clients. Ruth then reports Bobs crimes to the IRS.

Meanwhile, Marys life crumbles around her, as her relationship with Bob grows distant, she has a hard time keeping Bobs children under control (since Bob is unwilling to enforce discipline with them), is forced to do various chores by herself, as her maid Ute (Susan Willis) is busy with the increased workload from the Patchett family, and her butler Garcia (A Martinez) is unwilling to help out, and Mrs. Fisher reveals Marys lifelong secrets to a reporter for People magazine while the Mary is in the house on the phone. Compounding matters for Mary is the poor reception of her new novel titled "Love in the Rinse Cycle," and learning of Bobs affairs behind her back. However, upon seeing Ute walk off the job and everyone partying around, she finally decides to regain control of her life; she fires Garcia and lays down the law with Bob, the children, and her mother.

Mary throws a party that evening to cheer herself up and also spend time with her friends, but police officers show up during the party with a warrant for Bobs arrest. After Bobs lawyer unknowingly reveals Bobs embezzling from her, Mary promptly dumps Bob and fires him as her accountant. Bob and his lawyer earlier tried to make a secret deal with one judge, but the plan falls apart as another judge takes the case (as a result of Ruth calling in a favor from another one of her clients). Bob is convicted and sentenced to eighteen months in prison, thus destroying his last asset - his freedom.

Eighteen months pass, and Bob is released after fully serving his sentence, having greatly reformed and looking forward to spending time with his family, while Mary sold her mansion and released a new novel "Trust and Betrayal: A Docu-novel of Love, Money and Skepticism," which proves to be a critical and commercial success. Ruth appears at the book signing and asks the autograph to be made out to "Ruth." Mary experiences a brief lapse of déjà vu, but shrugs it off. Next in line after Ruth is Alain, a handsome Frenchman whom Mary flirts with, showing that she is back to her old ways.
