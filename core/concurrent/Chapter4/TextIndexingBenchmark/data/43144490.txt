}} animated musical film, made for television. It has been compared to films like Fantasia (1940 film)|Fantasia  and Allegro Non Troppo, and consists of 12 different segments,  each one of which is based on different popular operas and done in a greater variety of animation styles than Fantasia had done. It was nominated for best production at the CableACE Awards in 1994.

==Segments==
# Vesti la Giubba, extract from Ruggero Leoncavallos Pagliacci, sung by Franco Corelli and directed by Ken Lidster. A stop motion animation of the operas plot with a dark comedy theme and the characters rendered as circus-style clowns. A "happier" ending is shown with the 2D-animated ghost of Nedda reconciling with Canio after he had accidentally killed her.
# La Donna è Mobile, extract from Giuseppe Verdis Rigoletto, sung by Nicolai Gedda and directed by Monique Renault. In the crimson heart of the wine in his glass, the (live-acted) Duke of Mantua from the opera embarks on a 2D fantasy which he sees hand-drawn animated women based on those who come from famous paintings by French painters.
# Carmen, extract from Georges Bizets Carmen, sung by Les Petits Chanteurs à la Croix de Bois and directed by Pascal Roulin and Christophe Vallaux. Carmen (again live-acted) lays down her tarot cards which through CGI spring to life with the images the cards each depicting one of her choices from the opera.
# Voi che Sapete, extract from Wolfgang Amadeus Mozarts The Marriage of Figaro, sung by Susanne Danco and directed by Pascal Roulin. A tribute to Cherubinos cross-dressing adventures, rendered through paper cut-out style animation against CGI backgrounds.
# Madame Butterfly extract from Giacomo Puccinis Madame Butterfly, sung by Felicia Weathers and directed by Jonathan Hills. The story of Cio-Cio-Sans tragedy is rendered through animation in the style of traditional Japanese watercolors.
# Pêcheurs de Perles, extract from Georges Bizets Les pêcheurs de perles, sung by Nicolai Gedda and Ernest Blanc and directed by Jimmy T. Murakami. A wispy, black-and-white, rotoscoped animation depicting a condensed version of the plot to its most famous aria.
# Du also bist mein Braütigam, extract from Wolfgang Amadeus Mozarts The Magic Flute, sung by Lucia Popp and directed by Raimund Krumme. A CGI, geometrical version of the scene of Paminas attempt at suicide and its prevention, with all the characters bodies rendered in geometrical shapes on an ever shifting stage. Stephen Palmer. A sunny take of the opera through hand-drawn animation with the characters randomly turning into each other as well as characters from other fairy tales.
# Le Veau dOr, extract from Charles Gounods Faust (opera)|Faust, sung by Nicolai Ghiaurov and directed by Hilary Audus. A hand-drawn, sketchy rendition of the ill-fated romance between Faust and Marguerite as the booming voice of Mephistopheles, who manipulates them like puppets, sings throughout the segment.
# Noi Siamo Zingarelle, extract from Giuseppe Verdis La traviata, sung by the Chorus of the Accademia Nazionale di Santa Cecilia of Rome and directed by Guionne Leroy. An unrelated version of the opera with crudely claymotion blobs of food attempting to bring color to a white world.
# Lakmé, extract from  Léo Delibess Lakmé, sung by Mady Mesplé and Danielle Millet and directed by Pascal Roulin. A rendition of the plot in which Lakmés hands, through CGI, turn into various flora and fauna of the Indian jungles.
# E Lucevan le Stelle extract from Giacomo Puccinis Tosca, sung by Carlo Bergonzi and directed by José Abel. An eerie hand-drawn animation depicting Cavaradossis final hours of life observed by the angel of death.
