 Philippine movie starring Rosanna Roces and John Arcilla. Produced by Reyna Films and locally released by Star Cinema, it is one of the projects by Reyna Films that became a blockbuster.  This marks Roces first appearances after ending her stint as a contract star for Seiko Films.

==Synopsis==
Ligaya (Roces) is a veteran prostitute whose name means "Happiness|joy", and is ironically tired and unhappy with her lifestyle. Having saved enough money, she decides to leave whoring for good, but love unexpectedly comes her way in the form of a sincere and honest farmer called Poldíng (Arcilla). The farmer, who falls madly in love with her, is Ligayas ticket to a decent, respectable life.

Roces oft-quoted line from the film is "Ligaya ang itawag mo sa akin, yan ang trabaho ko, nagbibigáy-ligaya." ("Call me Joy, thats my job, giving joy"). It is often used in a humorous context, where the speaker parodies the catty attitude of a prostitute advertising her ability to give "sexual gratification|pleasure".
