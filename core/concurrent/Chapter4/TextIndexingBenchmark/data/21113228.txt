Her first child, "Mongo" (short for Mongoloid), has Down syndrome and is being cared for by Precious grandmother, though Mary forces the family to pretend that Mongo lives with her and Precious so she can receive extra money from the government. When Precious second pregnancy is discovered, her high school principal arranges for her to attend an alternative school, where she hopes Precious can change her lifes direction. Precious finds a way out of her traumatic daily life by escaping into daydreams. In her mind, she has created an alternate world where she is loved and appreciated.

Inspired by her new teacher, Blu Rain (Paula Patton), Precious finally learns to read and write.

While Precious is in the hospital giving birth to her second child, Abdul, she meets John McFadden (Lenny Kravitz), a nursing assistant who shows her kindness. After her mother hits her and deliberately drops 3-day-old Abdul, Precious fights back and flees her home with Abdul. As they set out, she stops at a church window and watches the choir singing a Christmas hymn inside, imagining that she and her fantasy boyfriend are together and singing a more upbeat version of the song. Precious breaks into her school classroom because it is cold and she has nowhere to go. After Blu discovers her the next morning, she frantically calls local shelters looking for a safe place for Precious to stay. Later that night, Precious stays with Blu and her live-in partner (leading Precious to speculate that Blu is a lesbian). The next morning, Ms. Rain takes her and Abdul to find assistance for them.

===Box office===
Precious was given a limited-theatrical release on November 6th, 2009, and was originally scheduled to appear on screens only in North America. Due to the mature subject matter of the film, it was rated "R" by the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) in the United States, specifically for strong depiction of "child abuse including sexual assault, and pervasive indecent language".  During its opening weekend, the film earned $1,872,458, which placed twelfth on that weekends box office list, despite being in only 18 theaters.     The film saw a 214 percent increase in its second week of release, earning $5,874,628 at 174 theaters, which catapulted it up to third place in that weekends box office, with a per-theater average of $33,762.    On November 20, 2009, the film received a wider release, showing at 629 theaters (thus tripling the number of theaters showing the film).  In its third week, Precious, as studios had previously estimated, placed sixth at the box office, with the revenues estimated $11,008,000 an 87.4% increase from the previous week. 

After riding that three-week wave of success, Precious began to see a decrease in box office earnings. However, the film holds the record as the highest grossing picture to open in fewer than 100 theaters, and holds the record for the highest grossing average per screen for films shown in fewer than 50 theaters.  Brandon Grey of Box Office Mojo described Precious as having had a "robust expansion" in its second week of release, and he confirmed that the film holds the record for having the second-highest grossing weekend for a movie playing at fewer than 200 sites, behind only Paranormal Activity.  Precious grossed a total of $40,320,285 in over six weeks of release.  The film opened at ninth place in the United Kingdom, with revenues totaling ¬£259,000 in its opening weekend from a limited release of 47 cinemas, generating a ¬£5,552 screen average.

==Reception==

===Critical response=== SAG Award, BAFTA and an Academy Award.]] rating average normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from film critics, gave the film a rating score of 79 based on 36 reviews, indicating "Generally favorable reviews."   

John Anderson, of Variety (magazine)|Variety, said "to simply call it harrowing or unsparing doesn‚Äôt quite cut it," having felt that the film is "courageous and uncompromising, a shaken cocktail of debasement and elation, despair and hope."    Anderson cited Careys performance as "pitch perfect" and Pattons role as Ms. Blu Rain as "disarming."  Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly, praised Careys performance, describing it as having been "an authentically deglammed compassion" and praised the film for capturing "how a lost girl rouses herself from the dead" and for Daniels showing "unflinching courage as a filmmaker by going this deep into the pathologies that may still linger in the closets of some impoverished inner-city lives."  Gleiberman described the film as being a movie "that makes you think, There but for the grace of God go I.   Its a potent and moving experience, because by the end you feel youve witnessed nothing less than the birth of a soul" and felt that the "final scene of revelation" between Sidibes and MoNiques characters was strong enough to be able to leave viewers "tearful, shaken,   dazed with pity and terror."    He identifies how Daniels uses one of the rich scenes created by Fletcher to position MoNique in a painful confrontation with Sidibe that results in a masterful and thought-provoking performance that delivers the final "push" needed by Sidibe: "The more Precious tries to get away from her mother, the more shes pulled back". 
 casting the actors for their names, "he was able to see beneath the surface and trust that they had within the emotional resources to play these women, and he was right."    Betsey Sharkey, of the Los Angeles Times describes the film as being a "rough-cut diamond...   rare blend of pure entertainment and dark social commentary, it is a shockingly raw, surprisingly irreverent and absolutely unforgettable story."  Claudia Puig, of USA Today says that while there are "melodramatic moments" in the film, the cast gives "remarkable performances" to show the audiences the films "inspiring message."    Peter Travers, of Rolling Stone called MoNique "dynamite," a performance that "tears at your heart."   

Mary Pols of Time (magazine)|Time praised the films fantasy sequences for being able to show the audience a "joyous Wizard of Oz energy" that is able to "open the door into Preciouss mind in a way even   Sapphire couldnt."  Pols felt that, while not implying that the film has "a lack of compelling emotional material" but that the films "few weak moments" are the "ones that dovetail with typical inspirational stories."    Marshall Fine, of The Huffington Post, praised the film as being "a film that doesnt shy away from the depths to which human beings can sink, but it also shows the strength and resilience of which we are capable, even at our lowest moments."    Scott Mendelson, also of The Huffington Post, felt that when you put the "glaring issues aside," the film "still works as a potent character study and a glimpse inside a world wed rather pretend does not exist in America." But while the film "succeeds as a powerful acting treat and a potent character study, there are some major narrative issues that prevent the film from being an accidental masterpiece."    Mendelson described the film as being "an acting powerhouse" based on its many emotional themes. 

Critic Jack Mathews wrote: "Without being familiar with the source material, you really have no idea how much work went into the adaptation or how well it was done.... Precious: Based on the Novel Push by Sapphire... First-time screenwriter Geoffrey Fletcher did yeomans work turning Sapphires graphic, idiomatic novel into a coherent and inspiring story about the journey of an abused Harlem teenager." 

Erin Aubry Kaplan writes on Salon.com that the question posed by the film is how to assess the "hopeless story of a ghetto teen... in the Age of Obama." She goes on to say that "Precious proves you dont always have to choose between artistic and commercial success; the films first opening weekend was record-breaking. Its a sign how much we needed to tell this story. And, perhaps, how many stories there are left to tell." 

A. O. Scott identifies the scripts precise use of force and adept use of language, including a memorable line created by Fletcher for the adaptation: a "risky, remarkable film adaptation, written by Geoffrey Fletcher, the facts of Preciouss life are also laid out with unsparing force (though not in overly graphic detail). But just as Push achieves an eloquence that makes it far more than a fictional diary of extreme dysfunction, so too does Precious avoid the traps of well-meaning, preachy lower-depths realism. It howls and stammers, but it also sings...Inarticulate and emotionally shut down, her massive body at once a prison and a hiding place, Precious is also perceptive and shrewd, possessed of talents visible only to those who bother to look. At its plainest and most persuasive, her story is that of a writer discovering a voice. These people talked like TV stations I didnt even watch, she remarks of Ms. Rain and her lover (Kimberly Russell), displaying her awakening literary intelligence even as she marvels at the discovery of her ignorance." 
 Dana Stevens of Slate disagrees with Gleibermans suggestion that the "film makes you think" and argues that the films "eagerness" to "drag" the audience "through the lower depths of human experience" leaves little space for independent "conclusions". Stevens noted that while the film is about improvement and self-actualization, "it wields an awfully large cudgel" in contrast to Scotts view of balance: "unsparing force (though not in overly graphic detail)". Perhaps sharing Mathews view regarding the daunting challenge of adapting the harsh story of Push, Stevens observes that "Daniels and Fletcher no doubt intended for their film to lend a voice to the kind of protagonist too often excluded from American movie screens: a poor, black, overweight single mother from the inner city."

Stevens noted that while the film is about improvement and self-actualisation, "it wields an awfully large cudgel."   
Peter Bradshaw wrote in The Guardian that the film catalogues a "horrendous, unending nightmare of abuse" and then abruptly turns into something resembling Fame (1980 film)|Fame. Bradshaw commended the films acting and energy but said it was not quite the "transcendent masterpiece" some had made it out to be. 
Sukhdev Sandhu said in The Daily Telegraph that he found the film "a dispiriting mix of clich√© and melodrama," although he acknowledged that the film does feature some superb acting.
