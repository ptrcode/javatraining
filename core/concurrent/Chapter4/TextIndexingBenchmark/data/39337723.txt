 David Jones. The film first aired on the Lifetime Television network on March 9, 1994. 

==Background==
The film stars Amy Madigan as Roxy Ventola, Dennis Boutsikaris as Vinnie Ventola, and Jane Daly as Lorrie. Other cast members in the film include Jennifer Hetrick as Janet, Martha Henry as Dr. Moore, and Kenneth Welsh as David Burns.  The films production companies were Freyda Rothstein Productions and Hearst Entertainment Productions. 

Based on real events, the film follows the story of two Los Angeles-based screenwriters who had attended a fertility clinic in order to conceive a child, before HIV testing became routine. The couples implant was successful, but the family discovered they had the AIDS virus. Vinnie Ventola died in 1991, and the baby Miranda died of the disease only a day later.   Roxy Ventola was a co-producer of And Then There was One and she remarried in 1993, to AIDS activist Matthew McGrath, before dying from AIDS on November 14 1994. 

She had become an activist herself and a successful advocate for peer counseling and peer support programs. She was president of the Board of Women at Risk, a support service for women with HIV/AIDS; a co-founding member of Women Alive, a peer group run by and for women volunteers with HIV/AIDS; a founding member of Friends for Life, a support service for heterosexuals with HIV/AIDS; and an active member  of ACT UP/LA. Her play, After the Bomb, which was about a post-AIDS world, was produced in the spring of 1994, at Open Fist Theater in Los Angeles. She performed in the Michael Kerns play, "AIDS, US Women: Silent NO More."    

Madigan was the winner of the CableACE award for "Actress in a Movie or Miniseries" for her performance in And Then There was One.  In her acceptance speech she gave tribute to the Ventola family and mentioned that Roxy had since died.

==Reception==
Bernadette McCallion of Allmovie gave the film two and a half stars out of five and called the film a "heart-wrenching made-for-cable drama".

Diane Wild of DVD Verdict reviewed the film in 2005; "And Then There Was One is an unfortunately titled 1993 made-for-TV movie based on the tragic true story of television writers Vinnie and Roxy Ventola and their baby daughter Miranda, who were all diagnosed with the AIDS virus. The first 30 minutes feel rushed and beside the point, yet take up a third of the running time. The story loses its emotional effect because we dont get to know these characters as real people. Pre-diagnosis, we see a perfect marriage between two always happy and affectionate people. Post-diagnosis, we hear platitudes about God and thankfulness and overcoming adversity and prejudice, and the two take turns feeling despondent and optimistic. None of it really rings true, despite its basis in truth. The filmmakers may have thought the story was compelling enough on its own, but without the help of well-developed characters, it feels oddly jarring. The leads are fine, but some of the supporting characters — particularly the stream of doctors — are abysmal. The Ventolas friends are played by familiar and competent actors, but the characters are unmemorable. Criticizing this well-meaning film feels like kicking a puppy - a sick puppy - but its not a particularly entertaining hour and a half, when what should be a heart wrenching story is undermined by a script that treats its protagonists as saints instead of people. Unfortunately And Then There was One is too dated and simplistic to bring anything meaningful to the AIDS on film canon, and it doesnt manage to be a compelling drama outside of the real-life tragedy of the disease itself."
