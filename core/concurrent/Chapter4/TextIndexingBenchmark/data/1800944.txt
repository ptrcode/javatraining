==Plot==
Based on Hancocks childhood memories of Bournemouth, the movie is set in 1963 in the sleepy fictional seaside town of Piltdown. Hancock plays Wally Pinner, the unhappily married Punch and Judy Man. Wally and the other beach entertainers, the Sandman (John Le Mesurier) who makes sand sculptures, and Neville the photographer (Mario Fabrizi) are socially unacceptable to the towns snobbish elite.

Wallys wife, Delia (Sylvia Syms), runs a typical seaside curios shop of the time below their flat, and is socially ambitious. To achieve this she needs to have Wally invited to entertain at the official reception for Lady Jane Caterham (Barbara Murray), who is to switch on the towns illuminations, and at the Mayoress suggestion the Reception Committee invites Wally to entertain.
 illumination ceremony ends in farce when Wallys electric shaver shorts out some of the lights, causing some of the illuminated signs to display unflattering comments about the town. The dinner degenerates into a food fight when one of the drunken guests heckles Punch, and when Lady Jane rounds on Wally, Delia floors her with a punch. Her dreams of social acceptance are gone, but Wally and Delia retire, wiser and closer.

==Background==
The town of Piltdown is apparently named after Piltdown Man.

The film is a gentle but bitter-sweet comedy, and provides some considerable insight into Hancock himself. The screenplay by Hancock and Philip Oakes appears to be based partly on Hancocks own life and marriage. In one scene, Wally and Delia have breakfast in almost total silence, and the scene demonstrates that Wally and Delia are married from habit, and no longer have anything in common. The scene is often considered to be an observation on Hancocks marriage to the former Cicely Romanis at the time.
 porcelain pigs backside. The flowers were first intended to go up the pigs nose, but Hancock argued that the joke had to be stronger and so a prop with a suitable orifice was made. Delia later discovers the flower-abused pig in a socially awkward situation. The beginning of this scene was cut from the DVD, and from many television versions (though a still survives), leaving only the moment when Delia finds the flowers. 
 Nicholas Webb. The boy asks for a large sundae (a "Piltdown Glory") and Wally orders the same. Then, because he is uncertain of the correct etiquette for eating the dessert, Wally carefully watches the boy and imitates his every move. The scene was done in several takes and in between each take Hancock would rinse his mouth with vodka to remove the taste of the ice cream, which he apparently disliked.

Several actors from Hancocks successful television series,  , Hugh Lloyd, Mario Fabrizi and (briefly) Hattie Jacques. Syms was cast as Delia after  Billie Whitelaw withdrew. 

Roger Wilmut, in Tony Hancock: Artiste (1978), argues that the climactic food fight escalates too quickly and that a more experienced director would have been given it more time to develop comedically. 

The film itself was partly shot on location in Bognor Regis, and when the producers asked for some local people to take parts as extras, over 2,000 people turned up. Many parts of the town are immortalised in the film, from the Pier and the Town Hall, alongside other areas such as Spencer Street, Belmont Street, and York Road, beside the Esplanade and Royal Hotel, where in fact the film crew stayed. Tony Hancock himself stayed at the more expensive and smarter Royal Norfolk Hotel during filming.
