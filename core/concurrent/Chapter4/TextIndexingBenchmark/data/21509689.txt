}} Italian film directed by Paolo Cavara. It is one of many Italian giallo films to be inspired by Dario Argentos successful debut thriller The Bird with the Crystal Plumage. The film was shot on location in Rome, Italy in 1970. Though fairly obscure for many years the film has recently made a comeback thanks to the rising fan base for the giallo genre. The film has gained much praise from the horror community, one writer at Horrorview.com cited it as the best giallo ever made. Blue Underground Entertainment released the film on DVD in 2006.
