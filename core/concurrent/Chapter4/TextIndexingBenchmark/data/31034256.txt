==Reception==
Critic Hans J. Wollstein panned the film, writing, "In Destination Murder, former starlet Myrna Dell plays one of those hard-bitten, blonde schemers that no true film noir could be without. Unfortunately, both she and Stanley Clements, the only other interesting character in the film, are killed off fairly early on in the game. The result is a rather unsatisfying crime thriller where the Why? is more of a mystery than the Who?"   Herb Rau of The Miami News called the premise ridiculous and plot confused.
