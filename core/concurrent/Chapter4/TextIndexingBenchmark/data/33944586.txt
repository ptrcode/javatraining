==Story==
Mammooty is the centre figure of 38 patti , the man of honour who has dedicated his life for the welfare of the village people.  He is so respected that the people even erect his statue . As the people in his village would not take money for his shopping, he goes to a nearby village.  In the crowded fair (sandhai) Mammooty pulls Devayanis hand to save her from an approaching cobra.  Unfortunately nobody but the hero and his car driver seems to have noticed the cobra.  Devayani makes a big fuss of the event by assuming Mammooty to be a rogue.  The local big boys (Ranjith and Mansoor), who are also in similar status as Mammooty in their village, beat him up in public without taking notice of his defense.

Mammooty warns his driver not to mention the humiliating incident to anyone and pretends the injuries were due to an accident. Poor mother Manorama believes so.  However, Ranjith and co. later realize that Mammooty actually helped Devayani from snake bite and regret the incident.  As per his fathers advice, Ranjith  jets off to Mammootys village on the very night to seek an apology.  While Ranjith is overwhelmed by Mammootys generosity and forgivingness, the car driver, not able to contain the humiliation to his master, opens that up to his close friends.  The masses of the 38 patti arise, not only, to demolish Ranjiths village but also to burn his parents as well as Devayanis mother alive on the same night.  The returning Ranjith sees the destruction as Mammootys cunning plan.

The trio (Ranjith, Mansoor, and Devayani) vow to take revenge on Mammooty in a similarly cunning fashion.  However, Mammooty gets furious with his driver and his village people when he comes to know about the previous nights riot.  What can he do but to apologize to the victims, who see him as their villain and refuse to take any monetary help from him.  He offers to marry Devayani, as she has nobody left in her life to live with.  But she sees this as an opportunity to destroy Mammooty.  Both Ranjith and Mansoor are also convinced so.  The turn of events, one after another, change their mind about Mammooty.
