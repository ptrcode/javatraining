 Michael Hirst same title by Carson McCullers. The film was entered into the 41st Berlin International Film Festival.   

The storys protagonist is a lonely moonshiner named Miss Amelia who dominates a small Georgia  town.  She changes in attitude and kindness as two men, Cousin Lymon (a small, hunchbacked man claiming to be Miss Amelias cousin) and Marvin Macy (Miss Amelias ex-husband) enter her life.  Her general store becomes a center for culture and music, and The Sad Café itself becomes a symbol of Miss Amelias disposition.  Amid this plot, issues of work vs. pleasure, material vs. psychological health, and conflicting loyalties emerge.  The short story is told in flashback—giving the reader, first, a look at the ruined café before describing its heyday and subsequent demise.
