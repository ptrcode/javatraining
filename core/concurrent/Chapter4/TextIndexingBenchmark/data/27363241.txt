==Synopsis==
Sandhya Rani (Malini Fonseka) is an aging film star who was once the darling of the silver screen. Having lost fame and fortune in a changing world, she now lives quietly in obscurity. She ekes out a living by renting out a room in her home to the young film and television stars of today to satisfy their illicit sexual desires, and by selling dumplings.

Rani is introduced to Shalika (Dilhani Ekanayake), a popular film actoress, when she decides to carry on her affair with a co-star past shooting. Shalikas husband discovers this, and the scandal and publicity brings Rani and Shalika closer as friends. Rani is invited to a media program on television, as a backup, and after the interview, her profile raises again.

Priya Gunaratne (Nimmi Harasgama), is a woman in her mid-20s, who happens to be two months pregnant, unmarried, HIV-positive, and is employed at a karaoke night club. It is a tough life, but she is able to develop a friendship with another hostess named Bunty (Samanalee Fonseka).

Shalika tries getting in touch with Udith (Pubudu Prabath), her former costar and current lover, with the hopes that he will continue their relationship, but he decides to callously end things over the phone. Rani commiserates with Shalika by exploring her industry affair and the patriarchy inherent in the entertainment industry. Their conversation inspires confidence in Shalika; the next day she calls a magazine to announce that she will start working in teledramas. This opens more work opportunities and includes Rani in the teledrama.

Priya sees a clip from the serial on the bars television right before a fight between a regular client and an aggressive new client breaks out. Rani receives a call from the Colpetty police station with the message that a girl from a bar fight said that Rani was her mother. Rani responds,"The whole country knows I was never married." Priya is bitter about her childhood abandonment and makes it known to her mother that she still exists and that Rani is responsible for her present plight.

After the phone call and brief visit, Rani is visibly shaken. Shalika asks what is wrong, and Rani explains that she was discovered when her father worked as a light man in a studio. The owner noticed Rani and insisted that she start working in the industry. However, Rani was already married and had a year old daughter, and the studio could only work with a "virgin" star. Rani eventually separates from her husband and daughter, who were also paid off to leave.

Once this secret is no longer one, Rani decides to go to the karaoke bar to find Priya. Priya drives her away, further emotionally isolating herself. She asks Bunty to move in together and help raise the unborn baby. Rani continues looking for Priya, visiting the bar and even Buntys apartment.

Priya goes to the hospital and starts writing long extensive letters to Rani about her experiences growing up without her mother and with an alcoholic father. In the end Priya passes and Rani becomes the caretaker of Priyas baby girl.
