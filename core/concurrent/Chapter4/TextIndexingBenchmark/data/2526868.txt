 American hard superpowers to battle an evil inventor (Abner Devereaux, played by Anthony Zerbe) and to save a California amusement park from destruction.

NBC aired the film at the height of Kiss popularity in the United States. Due to the films poor acting and semi-comedic script, most Kiss fans disliked the film. Despite the films poor quality, it has attained cult film status. The members of Kiss themselves despised the film for making them appear buffoonish. For years after its airing, no one who worked for the group was permitted to mention the film in their presence. Lendt, C.K. Kiss and Sell: The Making of a Supergroup, Billboard Books, 1997.

==Synopsis==
  Magic Mountain, cybernetic creatures on display throughout the park. It is subsequently revealed that Sam has been transformed by Devereaux into a mindless cyborg through the use of a tiny mind-control device attached to Sams neck.

Devereauxs increasingly erratic behavior is a cause of concern for Calvin Richards (Carmine Caridi), the owner of the amusement park. Faced with a budget crunch, Richards decides to channel money away from Devereauxs projects in order to pay for a Kiss concert. Richards explains to Devereaux that the concert will generate much-needed revenue, but Devereaux is livid.  Later, three punks (dressed like members of a biker gang) sabotage one of the rides, placing a group of riders in danger. Richards blames Devereaux for the incident and fires him. Devereaux swears revenge upon Richards, the park, and Kiss, all of whom he blames for his misfortune.

When Kiss arrives for their show, Devereaux first attempts to discredit them by unleashing a robotic Gene Simmons, which proceeds to damage buildings in the park and to injure a security guard. The next day, Kiss is questioned by Richards and some security guards, but no action is taken. His first plan having failed, Devereaux attempts to sabotage the scheduled Kiss concert.  He manages to neutralize Kiss abilities and imprison them in his underground laboratory.  Finally, he sends the fake Kiss onstage, where they perform a version of "Hotter than Hell" (called "Rip and Destroy") with altered lyrics meant to incite the crowd to riot. The real Kiss manage to escape from Devereaux and fly to the stage for a final battle with their robotic doppelgängers. After the real Kiss dispatches the fake version, the concert continues and the crisis is averted.

After the show, Kiss, Melissa, and Richards converge on Devereauxs lab and attempt to convince Devereaux to release Sam from his control. But when his chair is spun around, Devereaux has newly-white hair and a frozen expression on his face. It is unknown if Devereaux is now dead, or has slipped into a state of catatonia. The group is despondent, but Stanley stumbles upon the mind control device on Sams neck and removes it. Sam returns to normal, with no memory of what had happened. Richards laments about Devereaux by saying, "He created KISS to destroy KISS...and he lost." The movie ends with KISS performing "God of Thunder" live onstage.

==Development==
 
Kiss commercial popularity was at its peak by 1978.  The groups gross income in 1977 totaled $10.2 million.   Creative manager Bill Aucoin felt, however, that the cycle of album releases and touring had taken Kiss as far as they could go, and that it was time to elevate the groups image to the next level.  He formulated a plan to cast Kiss as superheroes, a process that began with the 1977 release of a Kiss comic book.  The band agreed, and plans were developed for a Kiss film. 

==Production== Magic Mountain in California, with additional filming taking place in the Hollywood Hills.  Much of the production was rushed, and the script underwent numerous rewrites.  All four members of Kiss were given crash courses on acting. 

Prior to completing the script, screenwriters Jan Michael Sherman and Don Buday spent time with each Kiss member, in an effort to get a feel for how they each acted and spoke.  Frehley, known for his eccentric behavior, said little to the pair but "Ack!"  As a result, Frehley was not originally given any lines, except to interject "Ack!" at various points.  In the first draft of the script, Frehley was described as "monosyllabic and super-friendly. Communicating largely through gestures and sounds, Ace might be best described as an other-galactic Harpo Marx." Hicks, L. Wayne.  .  TVparty.  Retrieved July 27, 2006.   Upon learning of his lack of dialogue, Frehley threatened to leave the project — soon after, lines were written for him. Leaf, David and Ken Sharp. KISS: Behind the Mask: The Official Authorized Biography, Warner Books, 2003.  ISBN 0-446-53073-5   

The band, none of whom had any prior acting experience, had difficulty adjusting to the demands of filming.  Frehley and Criss, in particular, became increasingly frustrated with the long periods of downtime normally associated with movie-making.  They were both also dealing with increasing levels of substance abuse.  
 Michael Bell  (who had worked with producer Joseph Barbera on a number of past projects), as he refused to participate in post-production.   The only time Criss actual voice is heard in the movie is during an acoustic performance of "Beth (song)|Beth."  (Criss denies this story, stating that he "went to all the Dubbing (filmmaking)|looping.") 

On May 27, the last day of filming, Criss and tour manager Fritz Postlethwaite were involved in a serious car accident.  Postlethwaite suffered burns but soon returned to work for Kiss.  Criss injuries were minor. Gooch, Curt and Jeff Suhs.  KISS Alive Forever: The Complete Touring History.  Billboard Books, 2002.  ISBN 0-8230-8322-5  On a few occasions, Frehley left the set during filming due to arguments with the films director.  In one scene that Frehley abandoned, his African American stunt double can be clearly seen instead. 

The concert depicted in the film was recorded in the parking lot of Magic Mountain on May 19, 1978, in front of a crowd of 8,000 people. Tickets for the concert were given out by local AM radio station KTNQ which was where "The Real" Don Steele was a disc jockey. This is also the same radio station where KISS made an appearance as DJs on Steeles radio program the previous year while in town to record KISS Alive II at the LA Forum.  The group performed a full concert, which was followed by lip sync|lip-synched performances of some songs. "Rip and Destroy", an altered version of "Hotter than Hell" that was featured in the movie, was not performed during the concert. 

==Music==
The films music in the European release was purely performed by Kiss.

==Release and reception==
 n movie poster for Ataque de los Fantasmas (Attack of the Phantoms)]]
Prior to the films airing, a private screening was held for Kiss, as well as their management and friends.  Despite the positive reactions from all in attendance, Kiss hated the film for the buffoonish way it made them appear.  For years after its airing, no one who worked for the group was permitted to mention the film in their presence.  

In 1979, Avco-Embassy released Kiss Meets the Phantom of the Park in cinemas outside the United States, with translations of the title Attack of the Phantoms. In some countries — Italy, in particular — the film was simply titled Kiss Phantoms.  The theatrical release featured a vastly different version of the film, with several scenes that did not appear in the original television airing added to the cut.

The overseas films overall soundtrack also differed from the original — much of the Hanna-Barbera fight music was replaced by music from the bands own catalog, primarily from their four solo albums. In some edits, the promotional videos for "I Was Made For Lovin You" and "Sure Know Something" were also edited into the film.

In recent years, Kiss public statements concerning the film have been a mixture of bemusement and disgust. On VH1s When Kiss Ruled the World program, Gene Simmons stated that, "Its a classic movie... classic movie if youre on drugs," while Ace Frehley said that "I couldnt stop laughing from the beginning of the moment to the end" In an early-1990s Sterling-McFadden magazine interview, Simmons compared the film to the infamous B-movie classic Plan 9 from Outer Space, joking that the two films would make a perfect drive-in double feature.

In the years since its initial airing, Kiss Meets the Phantom of the Park has achieved cult status, mainly among Kiss fans.   It is currently available on  , a collection of concerts and television appearances (however, this is the re-edited European version, which contains hardly any of Ace Frehleys lines). Previously, availability was limited to two brief VHS releases in the 1980s and a laserdisc release in 1991.  In 2005, distributor Cheezy Flicks attempted to release the original TV film version of the film on DVD, but due to legal issues, the disc was quickly pulled.
