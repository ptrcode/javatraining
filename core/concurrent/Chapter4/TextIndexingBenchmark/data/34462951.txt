Greedy Lying Bastards is a 2012 American documentary film directed by Craig Rosebraugh. The film explores the phenomenon of climate change denial.

==Content==
Greedy Lying Bastards investigates the climate change misinformation campaign waged by the oil industry and its funded think tanks. The film exposes how a small number of well paid spokespeople have worked to confuse the public and lawmakers on the issue. Both ExxonMobil and Koch Industries are identified in the film as two of the worst culprits funding the denial campaign.  In addition to exposing the denial campaign, Greedy Lying Bastards tells the stories of those currently impacted by changing climate. These include residents of Kivalina, Alaska who are faced with relocation due to erosion of shorelines caused from rising temperatures and those in Tuvalu facing sea level rise. The film also covers the 2012 wildfires in Colorado, drought in Kansas and Hurricane Sandy. 

==Production==
Greedy Lying Bastards was directed, produced and narrated by Craig Rosebraugh. He co-wrote the film with two-time Emmy Award winning editor Patrick Gambuti, Jr., who also served as editor. Daryl Hannah was an executive producer and Michael Brook, who wrote the score for An Inconvenient Truth, was the composer. 

In making the film Rosebraugh sought to "undertake a project that would uncover the hidden agenda of the oil industry and provide answers as to why we as a nation fail to implement clean energy policies and take effective action on important problems such as climate change." 

The film began production in 2009 and finished late in 2012.

==Release==
