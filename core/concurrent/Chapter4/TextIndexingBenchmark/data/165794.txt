 Oscar (for gay movie" of its era, and was widely noted at the time for a 10-second kiss between Kevin Kline and Tom Selleck.

==Plot== Best Actor category at the Academy Awards for his portrayal of a gay soldier in To Serve and Protect. Cameron does indeed win the award, and in his acceptance speech thanks Howard, adding, "…and hes gay."

Howards family, friends, students, co-workers and Emily are shocked, but that is nothing compared to Howards own reaction of disbelief and indignation; he angrily reassures those who know him that he is heterosexual. Reporters invade his hometown, harassing him for interviews following the awards night telecast, and Howard is placed under the scrutiny of his boss, Principal Tom Halliwell, who is uncomfortable with the attention being brought to the school.

Although the other reporters leave after getting their story, one stays behind: on-camera entertainment reporter Peter Malloy (Tom Selleck), who wants to wait the week out so he can cover Howards wedding to Emily. Howard continues to be harassed and dismayed by the changed attitudes of everyone around him, and decides that he must sleep with Emily in order to prove his heterosexuality. Howard finds he cannot go through with it due to his conflicting emotions and Emilys concern for his well-being. Howard crosses paths with Peter, who reveals he is gay and, trying to provide a helpful ear, narrates his own experience in coming out to his family. Howard insists that he is not gay, prompting Peter to kiss him. Although shocked, Howard reacts somewhat positively to the kiss.

Howards final measure to restore his heterosexuality is the use of a self-help audio cassette, although that fails as well. During the wedding ceremony, Emily recites her vow without hesitation, but when Howard is prompted by the minister, he instead says, "Im gay." The wedding is called off, and although Peter is proud of Howard, Howard is angry with himself for hurting Emily. Howard is fired from the school because of his outing.

Despite no longer being on the faculty, Howard attends the graduation ceremony to support his students. When one student who got into college -- thanks to Howards hard work -- learns that he was dismissed for being gay, he and his classmates proclaim themselves to be gay as well, showing their support. Howards family follows suit, as do his friends, and all the townsfolk assembled. Having learned of the ensuing media blitz while in Los Angeles, Cameron flies to his hometown with his supermodel girlfriend to support his former teacher. Although Howard does not win "Teacher Of The Year," Cameron presents him with his Oscar.
