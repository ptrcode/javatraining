Another You is a 1991 American comedy film. It was the final film pairing of Richard Pryor and Gene Wilder, neither of whom appeared again in a leading role in another film, together or apart.
 Vanessa Williams and Kevin Pollak.

==Plot==
George, a former mental patient and pathological liar, is released from the hospital, and he is quickly, purposefully mistaken for millionaire brewery heir Abe Fielding by a troop of actors hired by the dubious and unscrupulous business manager Rupert. Rupert needs George to believe he is Fielding in order to kill him off and inherit the Fielding Brewery and family fortune. Eddie Dash, a con man who tenuously and forcefully befriends George due to a community service assignment attempts at first to capitalize on Georges mistaken identity--but after being conned by Rupert into killing George for profit, turns the tables on Rupert and helps George fake his death, only to come back to the land of the living and inheriting both the brewery and the Fielding fortune instead. Along the way, Eddie and George turn two of Ruperts female associates into allies and partners--while getting themselves into plenty of contrived comical chaos and hilarity.
