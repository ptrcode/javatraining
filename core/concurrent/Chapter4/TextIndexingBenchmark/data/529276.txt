 worst movies of all time.

==Plot==
 
On Amity Island, sheriff Martin Brody (Roy Scheider), the hero of two previous shark attacks, has died from a heart attack. His wife, Ellen Brody (Lorraine Gary), attributes it to the fear of sharks. She now lives with Brodys younger and more obedient son Sean (Mitchell Anderson) and his fiancée Tiffany (Mary Smith). Sean works as a police deputy and is sent to clear a log from a buoy a few days before Christmas. As he does so, a massive great white shark bursts out of the water, severing his arm, then pulls him under the surface and drowns him, sinking his boat in the process. Seans calls for help are drowned out by the Christmas choir.
 Karen Young), and their 5-year-old daughter Thea (Judith Barsi) come to Amity for the funeral and encourage her to come to the Bahamas with them. At the islands, Ellen meets carefree airplane pilot Hoagie (Michael Caine). Mike—along with partners Jake (Mario Van Peebles), William, and Clarence—works as a marine biologist, studying snails.

One day, the same shark that attacked Sean unexpectedly appears and attempts to devour their boat. Jake is eager to do research on the shark, but Michael asks him to keep quiet about the sharks presence due to Ellens attempts to convince him to find a job on land. Ellen becomes so obsessive that she starts having nightmares of being attacked by a shark. Then she starts getting psychic feelings when the shark is near or attacks. She and the shark seem to share a strange connection that is unexplained. The crew decides to attach a device to the shark that would track its heartbeat. Using chum to attract it, Jake stabs the devices tracking pole into the side of the shark. The next day, Mike is chased by the shark and barely manages to escape unharmed.

Thea goes on an inflatable banana boat with her friend Margaret and her mother. The shark goes for Thea but attacks and kills Margarets mother instead. Thea and Carla are traumatized following the attack. Ellen boards Jakes boat to track down the shark, intending to kill it to save the rest of her family. Mike arrives at his house, and after hearing about what happened, lets it slip about the shark, which greatly angers Carla. Mike and Jake are flown by Hoagie to search for Ellen and find the shark in pursuit of their boat (which Ellen has hijacked). During the search, Hoagie explains to Mike about Ellens theory that the shark that killed Sean has followed her to the Bahamas to get revenge on the Brodys. When they finally find her, Hoagie lands the plane on the water, ordering Mike and Jake swim to the boat as the shark drags the plane and Hoagie underwater.

Much to Ellens disbelief, Hoagie survives. Mike is upset with Ellen because he was worried that she would have been killed by the shark. Jake and Mike hastily put together an explosive powered by electrical impulses. They begin blasting the shark with the impulses, which begin to drive it mad; it repeatedly jumps out of the water, roaring in pain. As Jake moves to the front of the boat, the shark lunges, giving it the chance to pull Jake under and maul him. He manages to get the explosive into the sharks mouth before he is taken underwater.
 her husbands battle with the first shark. The broken bowsprit impales the shark, causing it to explode. Mike then hears Jake calling for help, seriously injured but alive and conscious, floating in the water. The four survive the harsh encounter and make it back to land. Hoagie then flies Ellen back to Amity Island.

==Production==
Joseph Sargent produced and directed the film. He had worked with Lorraine Gary in 1969s The Marcus-Nelson Murders, for which he won his first Directors Guild of America Award.  Indeed, Steven Spielberg cites this television film, that later spawned Kojak, as motivation for casting Gary as Ellen Brody in the original Jaws film, besides the fact she was the wife of the studios chief executive Sid Sheinberg at that time.  In regards to Revenge, Gary remarked in an interview: "I made a good deal on this film, but I didnt make as good a deal as I would have if I werent married to Sid." 

In an interview with the Boston Herald, Sargent called Revenge "a ticking bomb waiting to go off. ... Sid Sheinberg (president of MCA Inc., parent company of Universal Pictures) expects a miracle – and were going to make it happen." Sargent got a call from Sheinberg in late September 1986, asking him to direct the fourth Jaws movie with no script yet written. Said Sargent, "I didnt have time to laugh because Sid explained he wanted to do a quality picture about human beings. When he told me, Its your baby, you produce and direct, I accepted." According to Sargent, Sheinberg "cut through all the slow lanes and got Jaws: The Revenge off and running."  In a 2006 interview, Sargent stated that the premise was born "out of a little bit of desperation to find something fresh to do with the shark. We thought that maybe if we take a mystical point of view, and go for a little bit of...magic, we might be able to find something interesting enough to sit through."  
 
Jaws: The Revenge was filmed on location in New England and in the Bahamas, and completed on the Universal lot. Like the first two films of the series, Marthas Vineyard was the location of the fictional Amity Island for the films opening scenes. Production commenced on February 2, 1987, by which time "snowstorms had blanketed" the island for almost a month, "providing a frosty backdrop for the opening scenes."    Because the sequel had to be ready for release by July of the same year and the mechanical shark had to be filmed in warmer temperatures, Marthas Vineyard only makes a cameo appearance in Revenge.

In addition to the 124 cast and crew members, 250 local extras were also hired. The majority of the extras were used as members of the local high school band, chorus and dramatic society that can be seen as the Brodys walk through the town, and during Seans attack. A local gravestone maker produced 51 slabs for the mock graveyard used for Seans funeral. 
 Nassau in the Bahamas on February 9, beginning principal photography there the next day. Like the production of the first two films, they encountered many problems with varying weather conditions. The location did not offer the "perfect world" that the 38-day shoot required. Cover shots were filmed on shore and in interior sets.  The film was shot in the Super 35 format. 

===Special effects===
The special effects team, headed by Henry Millar, had arrived at South Beach, Nassau on January 12, 1987, almost a month before principal photography commenced there. In the official press release, Millar says that when he got involved "we didnt even have a script... but as the story developed and they started telling us all what they wanted... I knew this wasnt going to be like any other shark anyone had ever seen." 

The shark was to be launched from atop an   long platform, made from the trussed turret of a   crane, and floated out into Clifton Bay. Seven sharks, or segments, were produced.

 Two models were fully articulated, two were made for jumping, one for ramming, one was a half shark (the top half) and one was just a fin. The two fully articulated models each had 22 sectioned ribs and movable jaws covered by a flexible water-based latex skin, measured   in length and weighed 2500 pounds. Each tooth was half-a-foot long and as sharp as it looked. All models were housed under cover... in a secret location on the island.  

The film company returned to Universal Studios to finish shooting on April 2. Principal photography was completed in Los Angeles on May 26. Millars special effects team, however, remained in Nassau, completing second unit photography on June 4.

===Underwater sequences===
Cinematographer John McPherson also supervised the underwater unit, which was headed by Pete Romano. Whereas underwater photography was normally filmed with an anamorphic lens, requiring overhead lighting, Romano filmed these "sequences with Carl Zeiss AG|Zeiss, a 35 mm super-speed lens, which allows the natural ambiance to come through on film."  Additional underwater photography was completed in a water tank, measuring   by   across, and   in depth,  in Universal Studios Stage 27. Also, a replica of Nassaus Clifton Bay and its skyline was created on the man-made Falls Lake on the studio backlot. 

A television documentary, "Behind the Scenes with Jaws: The Revenge", was broadcast in the U.S. on July 10, 1987. Twenty-two minutes in length, it was written and directed by William Rus for Zaloom Mayfield Productions. 

===Ending changes===
In the ending that was in the original theatrical version, Ellen rammed the shark with Mikes boat, mortally wounding it. The shark then causes the boat to break apart with its death contortions, forcing the people on the boat to jump off to avoid going down with it.    American audiences disapproved of this ending. A new ending was ordered shot for foreign distribution with the shark getting stabbed with the bow sprit and then exploding; and with Jake being found wounded but alive. This version is what Universal wound up releasing to VHS and laserdisc and later DVD. 
 Orange County, reshooting the ending prevented Michael Caine from collecting his Academy Award for Hannah and Her Sisters.    Other sources claim that the reshot ending began filming only five days after the movie was released and was going to be the version released in Europe.  One version can be seen on cable broadcasts, while the other version is featured on the home releases. 

The ending had left many audiences confused. In his scathing review, Roger Ebert says that he cannot believe "that the director, Joseph Sargent, would film this final climactic scene so incompetently that there is not even an establishing shot, so we have to figure out what happened on the basis of empirical evidence."   

===Series continuity===
No reference is made to the character development or events depicted in Jaws 3-D. In its predecessor, Mike is an engineer for SeaWorld, whereas here he is a marine research scientist.  Sean is not associated with the police force in Jaws 3-D, and there is no mention of their respective partners. One of the Universal Studios press releases for Jaws: The Revenge omits Jaws 3-D by referring to Jaws: The Revenge as the "third film of the remarkable Jaws trilogy."    However, even though Revenge removes Jaws 3-D from series continuity, the underwater chase scene between Mike and the shark in Revenge was lifted from an early screenplay draft of Jaws 3-D.  While Jaws 2 is presumably still part of series continuity, no specific events from that sequel are mentioned by the characters and none of the footage from Jaws 2 is used for flashbacks in Jaws: The Revenge.

===Casting===
  eight years earlier, as well as being her final film role.

The press release proposes that the character "had much more depth and texture than either of the other films was able to explore. The promise of further developing this multi-dimensional woman under the extraordinary circumstances... intrigued Gary enough to lure her back to the screen after a lengthy hiatus."    Although the film was always going to be centered on Gary, Roy Scheider was offered a cameo. If he had accepted it, it was his Martin Brody character, rather than Sean Brody, who would have been killed by the shark at the films beginning. 

Gary is the only principal cast member from the original film who returned, although Lee Fierro made a brief cameo as Mrs. Kintner (the mother of a boy killed in Jaws), as did Fritzi Jane Courtney, who played Mrs. Taft, one of the Amity town council members in both Jaws and Jaws 2. Cyprian R. Dube, who played Amity Selectman Mr. Posner in both Jaws and Jaws 2, is upgraded to mayor following the death of Murray Hamilton, who played Larry Vaughan, the mayor.

Caine had mixed feelings about both the production and the final version. He thinks that it was a first for him to be involved with someone his own age in a film. He compares the relationship between two middle-aged people to the romance between two teenagers. Although disappointed not to be able to collect an Academy Award because of filming in the Bahamas, he was glad to be involved in the film. In the press release, he explains that "it is part of movie history... the original was one of the great all-time thrillers. I thought it might be nice to be mixed up with that. I liked the script very much."    However, Caine later claimed: "I have never seen it  , but by all accounts it is terrible. However, I have seen the house that it built, and it is terrific!"  In his 1992 autobiography Whats it All About?, he says that the film "will go down in my memory as the time when I won an Oscar, paid for a house and had a great holiday. Not bad for a flop movie." 
 Halloween II. Karen Young played his wife Carla. She commended the directors emphasis upon characterization. 

Mario Van Peebles played Jake, Michaels colleague. His father, Melvin Van Peebles, has a cameo in the film as Nassaus mayor.  Mitchell Anderson appeared as Ellens youngest son, Sean. Lynn Whitfield played Louisa, and stunt performer Diane Hetfield was the victim of the banana boat attack.

 The hysterical coda tacked onto the end of "Revenge and Finale" is almost worth the price of the disc, as it no doubt sums up Smalls opinion of the film. Its sad that the great Michael Small was delegated utter crap like Jaws the Revenge in the late 80s&nbsp;– and even worse that he never found his way back to the material that he deserves.  

Upon Smalls death in 2003, The Independent wrote that the "composer of some distinction ... had the indignity of working on one of the worst films of all time". Like most reviews of the soundtrack, the article criticizes the film whilst saying "Small produced a fine score in the circumstances, as if anyone noticed."   

In 2015 Intrada Records, which previously reissued Jaws 3-D on compact disc, released the complete score.

The novelization was written by Hank Searls, who also adapted Jaws 2.  While Searls Jaws 2 novelization was based on an earlier draft of that film and was significantly different from the finished film, his Jaws: The Revenge novelization sticks fairly close to the final film, although it does contain some extra subplots. The novel contains a subplot in which Hoagie is a government agent and he transports laundered money. The only reference to this in the film is when Michael Brody asks "What do you do when you’re not flying people?" to which Hoagie replies, "I deliver laundry." In Searls novel, the character of Jake is ultimately killed by the shark; Jake was originally supposed to die in the film, but the script was changed to allow him to survive.

The novelization suggests that the shark may be acting under the influence of a vengeful voodoo witch doctor (who has a feud with the Brody family), and the sharks apparent revenge has magical implications. Therefore, the witch doctor is the revenge and the shark is his tool. This also explains the strange psychic connection Ellen and the shark have with each other. The plot was deleted as it strayed too far away from the plot of the killer shark. However, at one point in the theatrical version, Michael Brody says, "Come on, sharks don’t commit murder. Tell me you don’t believe in that voodoo."

Searls novelization presents a continuity that combines elements from Peter Benchleys Jaws (novel)|Jaws novel as well as the Jaws film series. The novelization makes a reference to Ellen Brodys affair with Matt Hooper, a subplot that exists in Benchleys novel but is entirely absent from the film adaptation.

Many scenes are considered implausible, such as the shark swimming from a New York island to the Bahamas (approx. 2000&nbsp;km) in less than three days, or following Michael through an underwater labyrinth, as well as the implication that a creature was seeking revenge. The Independent pointed out that "the film was riddled with inconsistencies   errors (sharks cannot float or roar like lions)".  The special effects were criticized, especially some frames of the shark being speared by the boats prow. Also, the mechanisms propelling the shark can be seen in some shots. 
 flashbacks to the first film. A scene with Michael and Thea imitating each other is interspersed with shots from a similar scene in Jaws of Sean (Jay Mello) and Martin Brody. Similarly, the sharks destruction contains footage of Martin Brody aiming at the compressed air tank, saying "Smile, you son of a ...," The New York Times comments "nothing kills a sequel faster than reverence... Joseph Sargent, the director, has turned this into a color-by-numbers version of Steven Spielbergs original Jaws." 

On TV Tropes, the film has the dubious distinction of being the Trope Namer for Voodoo Shark.
