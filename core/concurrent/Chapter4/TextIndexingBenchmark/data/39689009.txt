==Plot== asylum in Europe, the family first settles in London, where their residence proves ill-suited for a restaurant. They depart for mainland Europe.

Shortly after entering France, the brakes on Papas van fail near Saint-Antonin-Noble-Val in the Midi-Pyrénées. Marguerite (Charlotte Le Bon), a sous chef at an upscale French restaurant named "Le Saule Pleureur" ("The Weeping Willow"), passes by and offers to help the Kadams find an auto repair shop and a guest house. She brings the Kadams to her apartment and treats them to cold food. Papa is amazed at the quality of the food in the village and its availability and discovers that Marguerite made the food herself.

Papa learns of an abandoned restaurant building available for purchase.  Its located directly across the street--only 100 feet--from Le Saule Pleureur.  Madame Mallory (Helen Mirren), "Le Saule Pleureurs owner, asks the Kadams to leave because it is "private property". Papa buys the property, even though the rest of his family is against it, and names the restaurant "Maison Mumbai".

Mallory comes over to Maison Mumbai to ask for a menu and then buys all the locally available ingredients needed to cook their dishes on opening night. A  cold war erupts between Papa and Mallory. The war peaks on Bastille Day when one of Mallorys chefs, Jean-Pierre, and two others vandalize the Kadams restaurant by spray-painting words which translate to "France for the French" on the outer wall and firebombing the interior (Mallory has nothing to do with it). Hassan catches the arsonists in the act and scares them off, but his hands and legs are burned.  That evening Mallory fires Jean-Pierre and cleans up the graffiti on Maison Mumbais outer wall. 

Hassan, having heard from Marguerite that Mallory hires potential chefs by taste-testing an omelette and deciding whether the person is indeed a great chef, asks if he may cook an omelette for her to his recipe. Due to his injured hands, Mallory helps under Hassans supervision. After tasting the omelette, Mallory recognizes Hassans potential and invites him to work for her. Papa is initially against the move, but ultimately strikes a deal with her as to Hassans pay.
 Michelin Star. The award draws national attention to Hassans cooking, and he is offered and accepts a job in Paris. Papa and Mallory make amends and begin seeing each other.

Hassans cooking in Paris quickly receives critical acclaim, fueling speculation of a third Michelin Star for the Paris restaurant, but his work is increasingly bogged down by thoughts of his family and Marguerite (with whom he had an ongoing romance). Hassan returns home and reunites with Marguerite. He invites Marguerite to join him in a business venture—buying a stake in Mallorys restaurant, along with operational control. Hassan believes this will help the restaurant earn its third star. That evening, Hassan and Marguerite prepare dinner at Mallorys restaurant and bring the dishes across the road to the courtyard of Maison Mumbai for all to enjoy.

==Production== DreamWorks Pictures hired director Lasse Hallström to helm an adaptation of Richard C. Morais novel The Hundred-Foot Journey about two rival restaurants in France.  Steven Spielberg, Oprah Winfrey and Juliet Blake produced the film adaptation scripted by Steven Knight.    In an interview, Winfrey was quoted, "Food blends cultures and allows us to have just a little peek into someone elses life... It is about a hundred foot divide between cultures."  Winfrey chose the book on which the film is based as a "favorite summer read" in 2010. She said, "It’s about human beings coming to understand other human beings and more importantly, after you get to experience or step into somebody else’s shoes or see them for a real human being, how you understand that you’re really more alike than you are different"  Mr. Sanjeev Lamba the CEO of Reliance Big Entertainment stated that the film was a much celebrated release and is a close partnership with DreamWorks, reflecting a cross country association.
