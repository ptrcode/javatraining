 Joseph Mitchell.

==Plot== Joe Gould, bohemian and Max Gordon, and art gallery owner Vivian Marquie, among others, Gould is able to secure a nightly room in flophouses until an anonymous benefactor arranges accommodations in a residential hotel for him.

Gould allegedly is collecting the observations of average citizens to incorporate into his oral history of the world, fragments of which he has given to various people for safekeeping. Mitchell meets him in a coffee shop and initially is fascinated by the colorful character. However, with the passage of time, as Gould becomes irritatingly intrusive and demanding, disrupting the ordinary life Mitchell shares with his photographer wife and their two daughters, the journalist begins to question if the elderly mans 9 million-word opus actually exists or is merely a figment of his imagination.

==Critical reception==
Stephen Holden of The New York Times said, "Sir Ians ranting, fiery-eyed performance is the brilliant spark that ignites this otherwise rather somnolent film . . . The movie does a lovely job of evoking a boozy 1940s Greenwich Village of poetry readings, cavernous bars and raucous parties . . . Despite its rich period ambience and Sir Ians fiery acting, the movie never brings Mitchells relationship to Gould into clear enough focus . . . Lacking dramatic tension, Joe Goulds Secret settles for being an atmospheric scenes-in-the-life biography of someones most unforgettable character. It could have been so much more." 
 American Beauty pale by comparison." 

Edward Guthman of the San Francisco Chronicle stated, "  nails one of the best roles of his career . . .   directs with quiet affection and rare restraint." 

Edvins Beitiks of the San Francisco Examiner said, "The good looks, sounds, sights and acting . . . owe a lot to director Stanley Tucci . . . Holm and Tucci are as brilliant in Secret as they were in Big Night . . . The cast is outstanding . . . but the movie belongs to Tucci and Gould with no room, really, for anyone else."
