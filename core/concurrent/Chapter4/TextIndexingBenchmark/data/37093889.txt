==Release==
In December 1971 the MP for Ballarat, Dudley Erwin, criticised the use of government money to make Stockadeas it contained brothel scenes, and asked for it to be withdrawn from circulation. 

The movie struggled to get distribution. Hans Pomeranz and Kenneth Cook complained that the NSW government refused to enforce the Film Quota Act but at the same time prevented public screenings in unlicensed halls, stopping Australian producers from finding alternatives to screen their films. Hans Pomeranz issued a formal demand to Eric Willis, chief secretary of the NSW government for an inquiry into the New South Wales industry. He was ultimately unsuccessful. 

Pomeranz and Cook eventually distributed the film themselves. Commercial reception was poor but the film was widely screened in schools and on television.
