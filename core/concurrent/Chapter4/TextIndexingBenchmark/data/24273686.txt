==Reception==
Emlyn Williams performance was voted best in a British film for 1932.   

The New York Times found it "considerably more diverting on the stage than it is on the screen...It is a rugged shocker, and when it was not stripped of some of its good scenes it kept the spectator guessing...It is, however, a talented performance that Mr. Williams gives. Cathleen Nesbit does very well as the somewhat sinister dowager Lady Lebanon and Norman McKinnel, although handicapped by the direction, lends a certain distinction to the r√¥le of Tanner."  {{cite web|url=http://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9803EEDD1531E333A25753C2A9649D946294D6CF|title=Movie Review -
