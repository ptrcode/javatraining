==Plot==
Shriranga Deshmukh (or Ranga) is a frustrated man. His frustration is particularly towards the women in his life &mdash; his wife, his mother and particularly his ever-angry boss. He feels they are in control of his life. During a trip to his native village, Ranga participates in an annual festival. During this trip he discovers that he has now gained the ability to listen to womens thoughts. 

At first, he is confused. But soon, on being counseled by a female psychologist, he learns to look at his abilities as a gift instead of a curse. From that point onwards, the insight into the female mind helps him understand the women around him. It helps him see their frustrations and dilemmas brought on by everyday life.

Being good at heart, he slowly starts using this understanding to improve his relationship with his wife, mother, grandmother, his boss and even his father. He is also able to solve some of their problems, making them happier than before. As an incentive, he saves the city by foiling the plans of a would-be female terrorist. 

==Release==
===Critical reception===
 
Aga Bai Areycha comes as a surprise film, not in the plot, but the making, cinematography, choreography and overall presentation. Needless to say a talented actor, Sanjay Narvekar is able to carry the character of Shrirang with ease. Every Maharashtrian who has lived in Mumbai will be able to associate himself/herself with the life, house and family depicted in this film.

==Soundtrack==
The music of this movie almost breathes a new life to Marathi light music: The improvisation of the famous Durga Arti, the soul song "Mana Udhaan" and even the item number "Cham Cham karta", in which Sonali Bendre made a special appearance, which attracted much attention outside of Marathi filmviewing community, are some excellent pieces done by Ajay-Atul. 
"Maan Udhaan" is a beautiful song; the scene of the festivities in his village brings back memories of Ganapati Festival celebrated in Mumbai and elsewhere in Maharashtra.
