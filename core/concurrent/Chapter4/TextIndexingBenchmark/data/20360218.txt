}} action direct-to-video film released in 2003. It can almost be considered a remake from the 1983 film Deathstalker (film)|Deathstalker. It stars the American bodybuilding|bodybuilder, wrestler and actor Michael OHearn and Martin Kove, and also R&B singer Cassie Ventura had a bit part in the film.

==Plot==
 
In a fictitious land, the evil sorcerer Munkar (Martin Kove) oppressively rules. Some warriors, King Kandors forces, escaped into the forest, in order to continue to make a stand against the dark lord, but theyre finally defeated. Now the fate of that land rests in the hand of Kane (Michael OHearn), a strong and lonesome barbarian. One day, he saves a damsel (Ekaterina Drobish) and Wooby (Yuri Danilchenko), a small, bear like creature, resembling an Ewok from Star Wars, from some brigands. 
 Amazon warriors. She tells Kane that her clan kept the sword safe for 50 generations, in the Cave of Last Echoes, where Amazons by tradition are not allowed. Gilda joins the quest and they ride for the cave, unaware of the Dark Prince, Munkars enforcer, who was sneaking on them. Kane enters the cave with Wooby, they find the Sword of Justice plunged in a pool of saltwater. 

The Dark Prince knocks out Wooby and confronts Kane, and the outcome is Kanes victory, as he wounds the Dark Prince with the Sword of Justice and the latter flees. Kane and the others meet King Kandor, the true sovereign of those lands, dethroned by Munkar. Kandor offers the help of Zigrid, who joins them. Zigrid tells them of his plan to infiltrate Munkars fortress, find the Amulet of Life and put an end to the malign sorcerers reign. There would be a tournament in his castle, and the victor would become Munkars general and be granted immortality through his powers. They head for the fortress, passing through a village under attack by Munkars forces. Gilda and Wooby are taken away, and Kane slays the Dark Prince. Wooby frees himself and sneaks around the palace, hiding from the guards, while Gilda meets Gretchen in Munkars harem, and also Ilsa and Sevra, two arrogant slaves who thought they were Munkars favourites. One night yester to the tournament theres a great orgy for the fighters, and Munkar himself salutes them. Kane is masked to avoid detection, and Zigrid tells he has a bounty on his head. 

The next day, the tournament begins. Kane, (identified as "The Barbarian"), wins several fights. Zigrid also proves to be a fighter of worth, making his way into the finals of the tournament. After the tournament, Kane orders Wooby to supply the harem girls with kitchen utensils that could be used as weapons. Munkar requests Zigrids attention. He tempts Zigrid to kill Kane and bring him his sword, in exchange for the love of Gretchen, taking advantage of his feelings of envy of Kane, who was also in love with Gretchen and vice versa. Zigrid then goes to Kanes chamber and gives him poisoned food. Wooby returns to Kane to find him possibly dead. He then takes a long journey back to a desert, and comes back with a healing flower that restores his health. 

The next day, Zigrid wins the tournament and gives Munkar the sword and takes Gretchen as his maiden of choice, meanwhile the harem girls make their breakout, and Kane learns of the Amulet of Life hidden by Gretchen inside the mouth of a dragon statue, and he grabs it. Zigrid lies to Gretchen that Munkar killed Kane and they must run away, but Gretchen declines such plans. But then she finds Kane alive and well, and discovers Zigrids betrayal. Kane fights Zigrid and defeats him, but Munkar appears and takes the Amulet of Life, finally reuniting the three Magic item|artifacts, and he is turned into a monstrous and powerful himself, with superhuman strength and speed, and fights Kane. There are two interventions in the fight: one from the witch, who is presumably killed by Munkar; and from Gretchen that kills him with the Sword of Justice he dropped. At the end, King Kandor takes back the throne and Kane and Gretchen become lovers.

==Reception==
The movie scored mostly negative critics, and it was classified by many as mediocre or "average" at best, very few found it a good film.  It was as much a low-budget film as Deathstalker, but the latter raised better reviews.

==Trivia==
*Scenes were filmed in historic castles in remote areas of the Crimea in southern Ukraine. Most of the cast is of Ukrainian/Russian nationality.
*Child actor Yuri Danilchenko (who plays Wooby) can be seen undisguised in the kitchen scene, as the chefs assistant who tries to eat the cake.
*The producers fired the first two directors after principal photography. Henry Crum was hired months later to re-edit, re-write and direct 45 pages of new material in seven days on location in the Crimea.
*Most of the footage from Munkars orgy is actually footage taken from the film Deathstalker (1983). This includes all sequences including the chained girl and the pig-faced warrior.

==Deathstalker similarities==
Barbarian is nearly a remake of the Deathstalker (film)|Deathstalker film, a fact that made it a target to many negative critics. The plot, the villains name, and the tagline were taken from that movie, and there is even footage scenes taken from it. (In the cauldron of the witch, various scenes from it are showed, and also there is the staff acrobat scene (tournament) and some orgy shots, entirely taken from it.) There are little differences between both films, like the presence of Wooby in Barbarian and the transformation of Gargit and a different orgy scene in Deathstalker.
