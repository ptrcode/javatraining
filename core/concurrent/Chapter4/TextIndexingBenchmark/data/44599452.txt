== Plot ==
A young man by the name of Jack Standish, played by J. Warren Kerrigan, disappears on the eve of his marriage after the discovery of a financial scandal involving his father, John Standish, played by Winter Hall. In order to protect his father from public disgrace, Jack suddenly flees Boston and thus takes the fall. The young Bostonian ends up fleeing to Java and inevitably succumbs to the lure of the tropics. Months later, his fiance, Mary Rogers, played by Anna Q. Nilsson, follows him to Java in hopes of bringing him home. Once Mary finds him, she is faced with the challenge of reviving him, both mentally and physically. Her task becomes more difficult when a native by the name of Lullaby Lou, played by Winifred Bryson, and a Dutch trader by the name of Gordon Van Brock, played by Thomas Santschi, try to interfere with the couple. Mary and Jack are able to escape when a tropical storm hits and spawns a typhoon that destroys the coastal settlement.

The typhoon scene at the end of the film was shot at the Garson Studio. Forty-six thousand gallons of water was used, along with twelve wind machines which swirled the water around and flooded the Garson Studio. Harry Garson had eight cameras capturing the scene.  Lenore Ulrich, who was the star of a David Belasco film, visited the set on the day they filmed this particular scene and said, "It was the most wonderful thing Ive ever seen, either on stage or in a studio."
