Marty must repair the damage to history by causing his parents-to-be to fall in love, and with the help of scientist Emmett Brown|Dr. Emmett "Doc" Brown (Christopher Lloyd), he must find a way to return to 1985.
 Universal Pictures as distributor. The first choice for the role of Marty McFly was Michael J. Fox. However, he was busy filming his television series Family Ties and the shows producers would not allow him to star in the film. Consequently, Eric Stoltz was cast in the role. During filming, Stoltz and the filmmakers decided that the role was miscast, and Fox was again approached for the part. Now with more flexibility in his schedule and the blessing of his shows producers, Fox managed to work out a timetable in which he could give enough time and commitment to both.

==Production==

===Development===
Writer and producer Bob Gale conceived the idea after he visited his parents in St. Louis, Missouri after the release of Used Cars. Searching their basement, Gale found his fathers high school yearbook and discovered he was president of his graduating class. Gale thought about the president of his own graduating class, who was someone he had nothing to do with.  Gale wondered whether he would have been friends with his father if they went to high school together. When he returned to California, he told Robert Zemeckis his new concept. Klastornin, Hibbin (1990), pp. 1–10  Zemeckis subsequently thought of a mother claiming she never kissed a boy at school, when in reality she was highly promiscuous.    The two took the project to Columbia Pictures, and made a development deal for a script in September 1980.

The first draft of Back to the Future was finished in February 1981. Columbia Pictures put the film in turnaround (filmmaking)|turnaround. "They thought it was a really nice, cute, warm film, but not sexual enough," Gale said. "They suggested that we take it to Walt Disney Pictures|Disney, but we decided to see if any other of the major studios wanted a piece of us."  Every major film studio rejected the script for the next four years, while Back to the Future went through two more drafts. During the early 1980s, popular teen comedies (such as Fast Times at Ridgemont High and Porkys) were risqué and adult-aimed, so the script was commonly rejected for being too light.  Gale and Zemeckis finally decided to pitch Back to the Future to Disney. "They told us that a mother falling in love with her son was not appropriate for a family film under the Disney banner," Gale said.

}} maternity leave, he refused to allow Fox time off to work on a film. Back to the Future was originally scheduled for a May 1985 release and it was late 1984 when it was learned that Fox would be unable to star in the film.  Zemeckis next two choices were C. Thomas Howell and Eric Stoltz. Eric Stoltz impressed the producers enough with his earlier portrayal of Roy L. Dennis in Mask (film)|Mask&nbsp;– which had yet to be released&nbsp;– that they selected him to play Marty McFly.  Because of the difficult casting process, the start date was pushed back twice. Kagan (2003), pp. 63–92 

Four weeks into filming, Zemeckis determined Stoltz had been miscast. Although he and Spielberg realized reshooting the film would add $3 million to the $14 million budget, they decided to recast. Spielberg explained Zemeckis felt Stoltz was too humorless and gave a "terrifically dramatic performance". Gale further explained they felt Stoltz was simply acting out the role, whereas Fox himself had a personality like Marty McFly. He felt Stoltz was uncomfortable riding a skateboard, whereas Fox was not. Stoltz confessed to director Peter Bogdanovich during a phone call, two weeks into the shoot, that he was unsure of Zemeckis and Gales direction, and concurred that he was wrong for the role. 

Foxs schedule was opened up in January 1985 when Meredith Baxter returned to Family Ties following her pregnancy. The Back to the Future crew met with Goldberg again, who made a deal that Foxs main priority would be Family Ties, and if a scheduling conflict arose, "we win". Fox loved the script and was impressed by Zemeckis and Gales sensitivity in releasing Stoltz, because they nevertheless "spoke very highly of him".

Fox found his portrayal of Marty McFly to be very personal. "All I did in high school was skateboard, chase girls and play in bands. I even dreamed of becoming a rock star."

Doc Browns notable hunch came about because at 61" Lloyd was considerably taller than Fox at 55", and they needed to look closer in height.

 The Wild Life; the producers noticed her as they had watched the film while casting Stoltz.  Her prosthetic makeup for scenes at the beginning of the film, set in 1985, took three and a half hours to apply. 

Thomas F. Wilson was cast as Biff Tannen because the producers felt that the original choice, J. J. Cohen, wasnt physically imposing enough to bully Stoltz.  Cohen was recast as Skinhead, one of Biffs cohorts. Had Fox been cast from the beginning, Cohen probably would have won the part because he was sufficiently taller than Fox. 

Melora Hardin was originally cast in the role of Martys girlfriend Jennifer, but was let go after Eric Stoltz was dismissed, with the explanation that the actress was now too tall to be playing against Michael J. Fox. Hardin was dismissed before she had a chance to shoot a single scene and was replaced with Claudia Wells.  Actress Jill Schoelen had also been considered to play Martys girlfriend.

Following Stoltzs departure, Foxs schedule during weekdays consisted of filming Family Ties during the day, and Back to the Future from 6:30 pm to 2:30 am. He averaged five hours of sleep each night. During Fridays, he shot from 10 pm to 6 or 7 am, and then moved on to film exterior scenes throughout the weekend, as only then was he available during daytime hours. Fox found it exhausting, but "it was my dream to be in the film and television business, although I didnt know Id be in them simultaneously. It was just this weird ride and I got on." Michael J. Fox, Robert Zemeckis, Bob Gale, Steven Spielberg, Alan Silvestri, The Making of Back to the Future (television special), 1985, NBC  Zemeckis concurred, dubbing Back to the Future "the film that would not wrap". He recalled that because they shot night after night, he was always "half asleep" and the "fattest, most out-of-shape and sick I ever was".

 Frank Marshall, "the audience went up to the ceiling"), Sheinberg chose to move the release date to July 3. To make sure the film met this new date, two editors, Arthur Schmidt and Harry Keramidas, were assigned to the picture, while many sound editors worked 24-hour shifts on the film. Eight minutes were cut, including Marty watching his mom cheat during an exam, George getting stuck in a telephone booth before rescuing Lorraine, as well as much of Marty pretending to be Darth Vader. Zemeckis almost cut out the "Johnny B. Goode" sequence as he felt it did not advance the story, but the preview audience loved it, so it was kept. Industrial Light & Magic created the films 32&nbsp;effects shots, which did not satisfy Zemeckis and Gale until a week before the films completion date.

== Release ==
Back to the Future opened on July 3, 1985, on 1,200&nbsp;screens in North America. Zemeckis was concerned the film would flop because Fox had to film a Family Ties special in London and was unable to promote the film. Gale was also dissatisfied with Universal Pictures tagline "Are you telling me my mothers got the hots for me?".

When the film was released on VHS, Universal added a "To be continued..." graphic at the end to increase awareness of production on Part II. This caption is omitted on the films DVD release of 2002  and on subsequent Blu-ray and DVD releases.

This film received a 25th anniversary theatrical re-release in the UK and the US in October 2010 to coincide with Universal Pictures Home Entertainments 25th Anniversary DVD and Blu-ray Disc releases of the trilogy.   For its re-issue, Back to the Future was restored and remastered.

==Legacy==
  President Ronald Reagan, a fan of the film, referred to the movie in his 1986 State of the Union Address when he said, "Never has there been a more exciting time to be alive, a time of rousing wonder and heroic achievement. As they said in the film Back to the Future, Where were going, we dont need roads."  When he first saw the joke about him being president, he ordered the projectionist of the theater to stop the reel, roll it back, and run it again.   

The movie ranked number 28 on Entertainment Weekly s list of the 50 Best High School Movies.  In 2008, Back to the Future was voted the 23rd greatest film ever made by readers of Empire (film magazine)|Empire.

==Sequels==
Back to the Future s success led to two film sequels: Back to the Future Part II and Back to the Future Part III. Part II was released on November 22, 1989 to similar financial and critical success as the original, finishing as the third highest-grossing film of the year worldwide.   The film continues directly from the ending of Back to the Future and follows Marty and Doc as they travel into the future of 2015, an alternative 1985, and 1955 where Marty must repair the future while avoiding his past self from the original film. Part II became notable for its 2015-setting and predictions of technology such as hoverboards.          Part III, released on May 25, 1990, continued the story, following Marty as he travels back to 1885 to rescue a time-stranded Doc. Part III was less financially successful than its predecessors despite being better received by critics.
