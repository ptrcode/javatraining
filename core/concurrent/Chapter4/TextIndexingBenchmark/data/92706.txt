As time has progressed, a number of substantial assessments have become more nuanced and in some cases more positive,  Khan, Omar.    and now some critics have described Heavens Gate as a "modern masterpiece" whose 1980 re-edit after poor press screenings was characterized as "one of the greatest injustices of cinematic history."   

==Plot summary==

===1870, Harvard===
In 1870, two young men, Jim Averill (Kris Kristofferson) and William "Billy" Irvine (John Hurt), are graduating from Harvard College. The Reverend Doctor (Joseph Cotten) speaks to the graduates on the association of "the cultivated mind with the uncultivated," and the importance of "the education of a nation." Irvine, brilliant but obviously intoxicated, follows this with his opposing, irreverent views. A celebration is then held after which the male students serenade the women present, including Averills girlfriend.

===1890, Johnson County, Wyoming=== Johnson County, rustling and dissuades another from stealing a cow. At a formal board meeting, the head of the Association, Frank Canton (Sam Waterston), tells members, including a drunk Irvine, of plans to kill 125 named settlers, or "thieves and anarchists" as Canton calls them. Irvine voices his objections to these plans.  While the other members vote in favor of the plan, Irvine leaves the meeting, encounters Averill, and tells him of the Associations "death list". As Averill leaves, he exchanges bitter words with Canton and punches him. That night, Canton begins recruiting men to kill the targeted settlers.
 captain and later reads the names aloud to the settlers, who are thrown into terrified turmoil. Cully, a station master and a friend of Averills, sees the train with Cantons posse heading north and rides off to warn the settlers, but is murdered en route. Later, a group of men come to Ellas bordello and rape her; Averill shoots and kills all but one of them. Champion, realizing his landowner bosses are seeking to eliminate Ella, goes to Cantons camp and shoots the remaining rapist, then refuses to participate in the slaughter.

Canton and his men encounter one of Champions friends, Trapper, leaving a cabin. Canton tells Trapper he has only a minute to warn Champion and his protege Nick Ray (Mickey Rourke) that Canton and his men are waiting outside. Trapper runs back to the cabin to warn the two men. Trapper then emerges from the cabin and is shot, and a gun battle ensues. Attempting to save Champion, Ella arrives in her wagon and shoots one of the hired guns before escaping on horseback. Champion and Nick are trapped inside before Nick is shot and killed. Cantons men push a burning wagon towards the cabin and set it afire, trapping Champion. Champion writes a last note to Ella and Jim. Champion then emerges from the burning cabin, shooting at Cantons men before being gunned down. Ella warns the settlers of Cantons approach at another huge, chaotic gathering at the "Heavens Gate" rink. The agitated settlers decide to fight back, with Bridges leading the attack on Cantons gang. With the hired invaders now surrounded, both sides suffer casualties (including a drunken, poetic Irvine) as Canton leaves to bring help. Ella and Averill return to Champions charred and smoking cabin and discover his body along with a handwritten letter documenting his last minutes alive.

The next day, Averill reluctantly joins the settlers, with their cobbled-together siege machines and explosive charges, in an attack against Cantons men and their own makeshift fortifications. Again both sides suffer heavy casualties before the U.S. Army, with Canton in the lead, arrives to stop the fighting and save the remaining besieged mercenaries. Later, at Ellas cabin, Bridges, Ella, and Averill prepare to leave for good but are ambushed by Canton and two others who shoot and kill Bridges and Ella. After killing Canton and his men, a grief-stricken Averill holds Ellas body in his arms.

===1903, Newport, Rhode Island===
Thirteen years later, in the new century, a well-dressed, beardless, older-looking Averill walks the deck of his yacht off Newport, Rhode Island. He goes below, where an attractive middle-aged woman is sleeping in a luxurious boudoir. Averill watches her, saying nothing. The woman, his old Harvard girlfriend (perhaps now his wife), awakens and asks him for a cigarette. Silently he complies. Then, as he prepares to go back topside, he pauses at the door and quietly looks at her. She doesnt notice his stare. His chin trembles with emotion. Then, wordlessly, he returns to the deck as the yacht steams onward.

 Jim Averell Ellen (or Ella) Watson, he was murdered by rich stockmen two years before the Johnson County War began. Stockmen spread a story that Ella had exchanged sexual favors for stolen cattle, but this was false, and she was certainly not a bordello madam as portrayed in the film. It is unlikely that Watson or Averell ever knew Nate Champion. There are numerous additional ways in which the film bears little or no resemblance to real-life people or events.   

==Production== Best Director Best Picture) carte blanche. 

===Shooting demands, overruns, and endless retakes=== Glacier National Park,  east of Kalispell, Montana, with the majority of the town scenes filmed in the Two Medicine area, north of the village of East Glacier Park.    Shooting also included the town of Wallace, Idaho.  The project had a December 14 projected release date  and $11.6 million budget and promptly fell behind schedule. 

According to legend, by the sixth day of filming the project was already five days behind schedule.  As an example of Ciminos fanatical attention to detail, a street built to his precise specifications had to be torn down and rebuilt because it reportedly "didnt look right. The street in question needed to be six feet wider; the set construction boss said it would be cheaper to tear down one side and move it back six feet, but Cimino insisted that both sides be dismantled and moved back three feet, then reassembled. 

An entire tree was cut down, moved in pieces, and relocated to the courtyard where the Harvard 1870 graduation scene was shot. 

In yet another egregious example, Cimino had an irrigation system built under the land where the major battlefield scene would unfold, so that it would remain vividly green, to contrast with the red color it would later be awash with after the bloody carnage. 

Cimino shot more than 1.3 million feet (nearly 220 hours) of footage, costing the studio in salary, locations, and acting fees approximately $200,000 per day.  Privately, it was said Cimino had expressed his wish to surpass Francis Ford Coppolas mark of shooting one million feet of footage for Apocalypse Now (1979). 
 eponymous album (2011). 

As production staggered forward, United Artists seriously considered firing Cimino and replacing him with another director. 
 The Elephant Man (1980) for David Lynch in the interim, and then came back to shoot more scenes on Heavens Gate. 

Heavens Gate finished shooting in March 1980, having cost nearly $30 million.    During post-production, Cimino changed the lock to the studios editing room, prohibiting studio executives from seeing the film until he completed the editing. (In a 2015 interview, Cimino denied this ever occurred.) Working with Oscar-winning editor William H. Reynolds, Cimino slaved over his project.   

===Workprint cut and eventual plans for release===
On June 26, 1980, Cimino previewed a work print for executives at United Artists that reportedly ran a staggering five hours and twenty-five minutes (325 minutes), which Cimino said was "about 15 minutes longer than the final cut would be."   

The executives flatly refused to release the film at that length and once again contemplated firing Cimino.  However, Cimino promised them he could re-edit the film and spent the entire summer and fall of 1980 doing so, finally paring it down to its original premiere length of 3 hours and 39 minutes (219 minutes). The original wide-release opening on Christmas of 1979 had come and gone, so UA and Cimino finally set up a release date in the early winter of 1980. 

==Reception==

===Initial reactions===
The final cut finally premiered at New Yorks Cinema 1 theater on November 19, 1980. The premiere was, by all accounts, a disaster. During the intermission, the audience was so subdued that Cimino was said to have asked why no one was drinking the champagne. He was reportedly told by his publicist, "Because they hate the movie, Michael." 

New York Times critic Vincent Canby panned the film, calling it "an unqualified disaster," comparing it to "a forced four-hour walking tour of ones own living room."    Canby went even further by stating that " t fails so completely that you might suspect Mr. Cimino sold his soul to obtain the success of The Deer Hunter and the Devil has just come around to collect." 

After a sparsely attended one-week run, Cimino and United Artists quickly pulled the film from any further releases, completely postponing a full worldwide release.   
 Paint Your Wagon."  Kevin Thomas of the Los Angeles Times issued a dissenting opinion when he reviewed the shortened film, becoming one of its few American champions and calling it "a true screen epic" while stating that in two decades as a critic, he had never felt "so totally alone". 

The film closed after the second week, having grossed only $1.3 million total on its $44 million budget. 

Writing in the The Guardian in 2008, Joe Queenan declared Heaven’s Gate the worst film made up to that time. “This is a movie that destroyed the directors career,” he wrote. “This is a movie that lost so much money it literally drove a major American studio out of business. This is a movie about Harvard-educated gunslingers who face off against eastern European sodbusters in an epic struggle for the soul of America. This is a movie that stars Isabelle Huppert as a shotgun-toting cowgirl. This is a movie in which Jeff Bridges pukes while mounted on roller skates. This is a movie that has five minutes of uninterrupted fiddle-playing by a fiddler who is also mounted on roller skates. This is a movie that defies belief.”  

===Reassessments=== Robin Wood David Thomson Time Out London selected Heavens Gate as the 12th greatest Western.  While Peter Biskind covered the many excesses and problems with the movie in his book Easy Riders, Raging Bulls, he also noted that Heavens Gate was not dissimilar to other big-budget, troubled projects of the late 1970s and early 1980s (such as Steven Spielbergs 1941 and Warren Beattys Reds), and that the backlash against Heavens Gate could have easily been directed elsewhere. Biskind speculated that Michael Ciminos unpopularity was the main reason this film became so widely reviled.

Beyond this, part of the critical estimation of the film continues to be low; in 2008, film critic Joe Queenan of The Guardian named Heavens Gate the worst film ever made.  It holds a 58% "rotten" rating on Rotten Tomatoes, although several of the 40 reviews aggregated there were published for the films initial release. 

===2012–13 re-release and acclaim=== Festival Lumière in France. Venice Festival director Alberto Barbera described the film as an "absolute masterpiece" that had disappeared, and whose 1980 cutting was characterized as a "massacre" by nervous producers and had been "one of the greatest injustices of cinematic history" that had destroyed careers (Cimino and Kristofferson) following "annihilat " critical reviews. 

In March 2013, the new directors cut was again featured back in New York City in a week-long run screening at the Film Forum. A major article by New York Times critic Manohla Dargis opined that the films "second coming&nbsp;... brightens a murky, legendary work of art" in a restoration that also "reveals the contradictions of a great flop."   

==Controversy==

===Impact on the U.S. film industry===
The films unprecedented $44-million cost (equivalent to about $122 million as of 2012) and poor performance at the box office ($3,484,331 gross in the United States) generated more negative publicity than actual financial damage, causing Transamerica Corporation, United Artists corporate owner, to become anxious over its own public image and abandon film production altogether.

Transamerica then sold United Artists to MGM, which effectively ended the studios existence. MGM would later revive the name "United Artists" as a subsidiary division. While the money loss due to Heavens Gate was considerable, United Artists was still a thriving studio with a steady income provided by the James Bond, Pink Panther and Rocky franchises. But many movie insiders have argued that UA was already struggling at the time after the executive walkout in 1978 as well as the box office flops like Cruising (film)|Cruising, Foxes (film)|Foxes and Roadie (film)|Roadie, that were released earlier in 1980.

The fracas had a wider effect on the American film industry. During the 1970s, relatively young directors such as Francis Ford Coppola,  . However, the directors power lessened considerably, as a result of disappointing box-office performers such as both Friedkins Sorcerer (film)|Sorcerer (1977) and Cruising (1980), and culminating in Coppolas One from the Heart and Ciminos Heavens Gate. As the new high-concept paradigm of filmmaking became more entrenched, studio control of budgets and productions became tighter, ending the free-wheeling excesses that had begotten Heavens Gate.

The very poor box office performance of the film contributed to a negative impact on the Western genre, which had enjoyed a revival in the late 1960s. From that point on, very few Western films were released by major studios, save for a brief revival in the early 1990s with the Oscar-winning hits Dances with Wolves (1990) and Unforgiven (1992).

===Accusations of cruelty to animals===
The film was marred by accusations of cruelty to animals during production. One assertion was that live horses were bled from the neck without giving them pain-killers so that their blood could be collected and smeared upon the actors in a scene. The American Humane Association (AHA) asserted that four horses were killed and many more injured during a battle scene. It was claimed that one of the horses was blown up by dynamite. This footage appears in the final cut of the film.

The AHA was barred from monitoring the animal action on the set. According to the AHA, the owner of an abused horse filed a lawsuit against the producers, director, Partisan Productions, and the horse  . Retrieved March 19, 2013.

 picket lines outside movie theaters in Hollywood while local humane societies did the same across the USA. Though Heavens Gate was not the first film to have animals killed during its production, it is believed that the film was largely responsible for sparking the now common use of the "No animals were harmed&nbsp;..." disclaimer and more rigorous supervision of animal acts by the AHA, which had been inspecting film production since the 1940s.

===Workprint cut, premiere cut and an alternative cut===
Notwithstanding the five hour and twenty-five minute (325 minute) "workprint" cut shown to executives in early 1980, Cimino had rushed through post-production and editing in order to meet his contractual requirements to United Artists, and to qualify for the 1980 Academy Awards.  The version screened at the November 1980 premiere ran 3 hours and 39 minutes (219 minutes). Bridges joked that Cimino had worked on the film so close to the premiere that the print screened was still wet from the lab. 

After the aborted one-week premiere run in New York, Cimino and United Artists pulled the film; Cimino wrote an open letter to the studio that was printed in several trade papers blaming unrealistic deadline pressures for the films failure.    United Artists reportedly also hired its own editor to try to edit Ciminos footage into a releasable film with no real success. 

Ultimately, Ciminos second edited version, a 149-minute version, premiered in April 1981 and was the only cut of the film screened in wide release. This cut of the film is not just shorter but differs radically in placement of scenes and selection of takes.  This version, after leaving theaters, was not released on home video of any kind in the United States, but was later released on DVD in France ("la Porte du Paradis").

In 1982,  , Z Channels broadcast of Heavens Gate first popularized the concept of a "directors cut." 

When MGM (which acquired the rights to United Artistss catalog after its demise) released the film on VHS and videodisc in the 1980s, it released Ciminos 219-minute cut with the tagline "Heavens Gate... The Legendary Uncut Version." Subsequent releases on LaserDisc and DVD have contained only the 219-minute cut.

Due to the wide availability of the 219-minute 1980 premiere version of Heavens Gate and its frequent labeling as either "uncut" or the "directors cut," Cimino has insisted that the so-called "original version" did not fully correspond to his intentions, and that he was under pressure to bring it out for the predetermined date and did not consider the film ready, making even the 219-minute version essentially an "unfinished" film. 

The 216-minute version showed in Venice is quite similar to the 219 one, but with no intermission. Some shots in the second part are slightly shorter and a shot with a single line has been cut (just after John Hurt is beaten by Sam Waterson).

===149-minute cut===
In the 149-minute version of Heavens Gate released in 1981, the following scenes are cut: 
* Irvines speech at the Harvard graduation
* The co-ed circle dancing immediately following graduation
* Averill beating up the brute enforcer (who beats up the immigrant in front of his wife and kids)
* Averill passing the beaten mans widow in the carriage, asking her how shes doing
* The spitting fight between the two immigrant landowners in the cockfight scene
* The entire roller skating dance scene
* Some female immigrants carrying a load up the hill
* Champion almost shooting the stock grower that insults Ella Watson
* The scene where Ella Watson first leaves Champion to return to Averill
* The introductory part of the scene where Averill reads the names on the "death list" (the edited version starts with John Bridges firing the gun in the air, to restore order)
* Averill weeping to Bridges that he "hates getting old", while looking at the old photo of himself and his girlfriend
* The immigrants being informed that Averill quit his post, and Watson warning them the stock growers have arrived
* The last five or so minutes of the second battle scene, including the footage of the character crushed under the wagon and the woman killing him in mercy
* That same woman killing herself, post-battle, and Bridges and Averill surveying the carnage

===2005 radical cut===
In 2005, MGM released the film in selected cinemas in the United States and Europe.    The 219-minute cut was reassembled by MGM archivist John Kirk, who reported that large portions of the original negative had been discarded, making this an all-new radical version using whatever alternative available scenes that could be found.  The restored print was screened in Paris and presented to a sold-out audience at New Yorks Museum of Modern Art with a live introduction by Isabelle Huppert.  Because the project was commissioned by then-MGM executive Bingham Ray, who was ousted shortly thereafter, the budget for the project was cut and a planned wider release and DVD never materialized and probably never will. 

===2012 digitally restored Directors Cut===
In 2012, MGM released yet another version, digitally restored and 216 minutes long. It premiered at the 2012 Venice Film Festival as part of the Venice Classics series.  

The Criterion Collection released the restored 216 minute version on Blu-ray Disc and DVD on November 20, 2012. This "Directors Cut" was personally supervised by Michael Cimino and Joann Carelli.  Cimino explains in the special features portion of the DVD that this is his preferred version of the film, and he feels it is the complete version he intended to make.
