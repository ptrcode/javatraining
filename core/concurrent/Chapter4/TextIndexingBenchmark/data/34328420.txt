Product placements, besides the presence of the Toronto Maple Leafs brand, included visible use of Molson brand beer and scenes filmed at Eatons and the Inn on the Park hotel. 

==Release==
The films debut was in Toronto on 12 November 1971 and released the following week throughout Canada at 20 theatres which was then the widest distribution of a Canadian feature film. 

==Reception==
The film generally received negative reviews. Martin Knelman of The Globe and Mail found the production "downright head-clutchingly terrible."  Reginas Leader-Post cited "terrible acting and inane dialogue".    Dave Billington of The Gazette (Montreal) also panned the production noting that "most of the ingredients of a good film were there and they were sacrificed to box office expediency."  The Windsor Star was also critical noting such deficiences as "a sluggish pace and fumbling character development." 

Face-Off grossed $600,000 at the box office by early 1973. Although a substantial box office income for a Canadian film, the Canadian Film Development Corporation did not expect to fully recoup   its investment unless the film earned twice that amount.   

Upon the 2011 DVD release of Face-Off, Sun Medias Bruce Kirkland acknowledged the "cheesy" production but noted the historic value of filmed scenes which included professional hockey players which he deemed of superior quality compared to the "crappy TV archives" of NHL footage of that time.   

==Video release==
Face-Off was restored from an extant 35&nbsp;mm print and released in Blu-ray format by Video Services Corp on 15 November 2011.  Only 10,000 discs were produced, due to complications in obtaining permission from the NHL for the hockey footage used in the film.    The DVD release includes the Second City Television parody of the film, "Power Play", which featured John Candy as Billy.
