 Jim Thomas, John Thomas, and Graham Yost. In 2020, a manned Mars exploration mission goes awry. American astronaut Jim McConnell (Gary Sinise) coordinates a rescue mission for a colleague. Principal support actors were Tim Robbins, Don Cheadle, Connie Nielsen, Jerry OConnell, and Kim Delaney.

==Plot details== Cydonia region, by which they suspect an extrusion from a subsurface geothermal column of water, useful to future human colonization. After reporting this to the World Space Station, they hear a strange sound on their communications system, which they assume to be interference from their planetary rover. While they scan the formation with radar, a large vortex kills Nicholas, Sergei, and Renée.

After the vortex subsides, a large humanoid face is exposed in the adjacent mountain. ISS, having receiving Lukes message, a second ship is readied for a rescue mission: the Mars II containing Commander Woody Blake, Co-Commander Jim McConnell, and mission specialists Terri Fisher and Phil Ohlmyer. As the ship enters Mars orbit, micrometeors breach the hull. During repair, the external fuel tanks are overlooked, causing a leak and later explosion. The crew then board the REMO ("Resupply Module") orbiting Mars. Tethered to the others, Woody launches himself at the module, but is unable to properly land on it. Terri tries to rescue Woody, but knowing she would run out of fuel before reaching him, Woody removes his helmet, killing himself to save her. XYZ coordinates, but missing a pair of chromosomes. To complete the sequence, the crew dispatches a robotic rover to reproduce the completed signal. Following the transmission, an opening appears in the side of the mountain, which Jim, Terri, and Luke enter, while Phil remains at the repaired emergency return vehicle with orders to launch, with or without them, at the agreed time. 

The opening seals behind them, disrupting radio communication with Phil, and a three-dimensional projection depicts the planet Mars, covered with water, being struck by a large asteroid and rendered uninhabitable. A Martian then reveals that the natives of Mars evacuated their world in spacecraft, whereof one landed on Earth to create humans, who could one day land on Mars and be recognized as descendants. An invitation is offered to one astronaut to follow the Martians to their new home. Jim accepts the invitation and is launched in an oxygenated capsule, while the others return to Phil, and subsequently to Earth.

|style="text-align: left;"|"Sinise and Robbins, a couple of awfully good actors, are asked to speak some awfully clunky lines. When Robbins says, “OK, were ready to light this candle” before ignition, it sounds like a parody of astronaut lingo."

Mark Halverson, writing in  . Retrieved 2011-10-26.  Left unimpressed, Bob Graham in the  . Retrieved 2011-10-26.   ," by a long shot, but for 2000, itll do nicely."  William Arnold of the Seattle Post-Intelligencer, added to the positive sentiment by saying "Here and there an inspired shot makes the film come alive, and at least three of its sequences had me positioned well on the edge of my seat." 

Writing for   writing for ReelViews, called the film "Ineptly directed, badly acted, and scripted with an eye towards stupidity and incoherence, the film is worthwhile only to those who are in desperate need of a nap. And, as is often the case when a big budget, high profile motion picture self-destructs, this one does so in spectacular fashion."  Describing a mixed opinion, J. Hoberman of The Village Voice said the film encompassed "a touchy-feely esprit thats predicated on equal parts Buck Rogers bravado and backyard barbecue, the whole burnt burger drenched in Ennio Morricones elegiac western-style score."

 . Retrieved 2011-10-26.  Similarly, Todd McCarthy wrote in Variety (magazine)|Variety that the films "dramatic package that it arrives in is so flimsy, unconvincing and poorly wrought that its impossible to be swept away by the illustrated version of creationism on offer." He did note "Pictorially, the film is smooth and pristine looking. De Palma and his frequent cinematographer Stephen H. Burum go for their patented swooping and twisting camera moves whenever possible, and there are some very nice ones onboard the recovery ship."  Lisa Schwarzbaum writing for Entertainment Weekly deduced that "Mission to Mars wants us to think about lofty things: the bravery of explorers, the ingenuity of our nations space program, the humility required to comprehend the possibility that we earthlings are not the be-all and end-all of creation. But De Palmas film is too embarrassed, too jittery and self-conscious to hush up and pay attention."
