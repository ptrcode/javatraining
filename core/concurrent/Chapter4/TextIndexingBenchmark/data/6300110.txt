==Plot==
Chris McKinley (Jackson) is a recent college graduate backpacking through Europe.  He is trying to enjoy and gain as much as he can from his last days there before he starts his new career back in the United States.  When he reaches Pamplona along with two friends he meets a new trio of people.  He meets an Australian thrill-seeker, a Spaniard named Adella (Varela), and a provocateur (D. Hopper).  This new trio encourages McKinley to think about the life and path he has chosen to take and he does so.  When the time for him to leave becomes close he must ponder whether he should take the road to his fast-track career or take a new path into his life.

==Critical reviews==
Los Angeles Times: Writer-director Kevin Noland effectively utilizes his fine young cast and the natural beauty and rich culture of northern Spain in amiably posing a timeless question of youth. 

Film Threat: Beautifully shot and filled with lovable characters you could watch for hours, Americano is an amazing journey that makes one yearn for travel. 

Reel Film Reviews: Americano certainly succeeds as a romanticized travelogue, and if this doesnt make one want to grab a backpack and head for the hills of Spain, nothing will. 

Spokesman-Review: As Jakes Barnes and friends do in "The Sun Also Rises," Nolands characters are in Pamplona to, among other things, run with the bulls. Those other things include falling in/out of love...   drinking wine. 

TV Guide: Americano is a young mans film, and to Nolands credit its handsomely shot, well acted and more ambitious than the average first film. 

L.A. Weekly: Watching Americano is like hearing a long story about someone elses holiday, and while it seems everyone had a nice time, its too bad they didnt shoot a better film while they were there. 

==Reception==
The film is currently rated by 8 critics at 63% and by audience (968) at 61% on Rotten Tomatoes.
