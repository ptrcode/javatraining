At Last... Bullamakanka: The Motion Picture is a 1983 Australian comedy about a small town visited by a government official. It is noticeable for the number of music acts that appear. 

According to David Stratton, "the film had a very troubled and lengthy production history which presumably accounts for the first two words tacked on to the title". David Stratton, The Avocado Plantation: Boom and Bust in the Australian Film Industry, Pan MacMillan, 1990 p154
