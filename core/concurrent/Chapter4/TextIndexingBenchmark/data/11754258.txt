}} 1955 comedy JROTC program at Sheridan Academy, a Catholic boys military school, or be forced out of the Army.

The movie was filmed on   campus in 1955, with cadets as the actors in all but the  leading roles. Universal-International Studios chose St. Catherines cadets and location for their humorous comedy about the challenges facing the new commandant of a military school by the antics of a group of grade school cadets. The picture starred Charlton Heston, Julie Adams, William Demarest, and a full battalion of St. Catherines students.

This movie was one of the inspirations for Damon Wayans 1995 film Major Payne, and probably also for the 1984 TV movie Hard Knox.
