Stagecoach guard Larry Delong is ambushed by a gang of outlaws associated with a man hes searching for, Dan Marady, who murdered Delongs sister and nephew. But when he returns to the town of Deep Water, nearly everyone there believes that Delong was involved in the holdup, in which the stage driver was killed.

With no townspeople other than Orissa Flynn, his sweetheart, and Doc Winkler heeding his warnings that Maradys men are coming to rob the town, Delong is forced to take refuge in a casino. A lynch mob forms, with deputy Tub Murphy trying to hold them off until the sheriffs posse returns.
