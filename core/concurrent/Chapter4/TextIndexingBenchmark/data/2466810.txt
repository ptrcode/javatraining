==Plot==
Barney Springboro (Scott Baio) is a science nerd who obtains telekinetic powers after a lab accident. Along with his best friend Peyton Nichols (Willie Aames), a wealthy playboy with a dirty mind, Barney uses his new powers to take revenge upon bullies, cheat at sports, and expose attractive female flesh, particularly the beautiful but snobby Jane Mitchell (Heather Thomas). After typical hijinks, including an episode at the prom strangely similar to the ending of Stephen Kings Carrie, Barney comes to realize that the best girl for him is actually Bernadette (Felice Schachter).

Baio remembered the film fondly:
 Great movie. Loved it then, love it today. I get more people asking about that movie than anything, no lie. And I had a ball making that. A cute, fun teen movie, and it made money. And it had Scatman Crothers! He was a good guy, and supposedly he smoked pot every day. That’s what I was told, but I don’t actually know. But I got to work with Willie  , and it was a great experience... Good people, good crew, good director.
