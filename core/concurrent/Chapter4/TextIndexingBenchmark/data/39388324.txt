A Field in England is a 2013 British historical psychological thriller film directed by Ben Wheatley.  The film, shot in black-and-white, is set during the mid-17th century English Civil War. The film was released on   2013 on multiple platforms simultaneously, including cinemas, home media and video on demand. It was also broadcast on Film4 on the day of its release.   

==Plot==

During a battle of the English Civil War, an alchemists assistant named Whitehead flees from the strict Commander Trower. Whitehead meets Cutler and two army deserters, Jacob and Friend. Together they leave the battleground in search of an ale house. They encounter the Irishman ONeill, a man whom Whitehead has been sent to apprehend for the theft of his masters works and literature. ONeill quickly asserts authority over the group and tells them of a treasure hidden somewhere in a nearby field. 

After using Whitehead to locate the treasure, ONeill instructs Jacob and Friend to dig for it and he leaves Cutler to supervise. Jacob is under the influence of hallucinogens, and after several hours of digging he attacks Friend. Cutler attempts to intervene, and accidentally shoots Friend to death. Cutler is forced to finish digging by himself, whilst the others slip away unnoticed.

Cutler discovers that the "treasure" is just a skull. He angrily berates ONeill who promptly kills him and then pursues Whitehead and Jacob, who scavenge Cutlers weapons and return to the army camp. As they are preparing for an attack, Friend appears alive and reveals their location to ONeill. ONeill shoots Jacob in the gut, but Jacob returns fire and ruins ONeills foot. Friend brandishes a pike and charges ONeill, but ONeill kills him with his last shot. Whitehead takes advantage of the situation to finally kill ONeill.

Whitehead buries his friends in the treasure hole. Wearing ONeills clothes, he gathers his masters stolen belongings and returns to the hedgerow where he first met Cutler, Jacob and Friend, from which battle sounds are rising. After he wades through the hedge, he sees Friend, Jacob and himself standing together.

==Production==
 Sealed Knot, a historical reenactment society. In his research, Wheatley also learned about the use of hallucinogens during the 17th century. He said, "People were grinding mushrooms into dust and blowing it into people’s faces and then doing magic tricks."    Wheatley sought funding to produce the film, which he had planned for years.  The film was ultimately developed and financed by Film4.0, a division of Film4 that serves as an innovation hub. Variety reported that the film was described as "a psychedelic trip into magic and madness". Wheatley said A Field in England combines "the more psychedelic elements" from his previous films Kill List and Sightseers and "weaves in our take on historical drama" with the English Civil War.   
 The Artist, Much Ado About Nothing, Frances Ha and Nebraska (film)|Nebraska.  Wheatley said he and cinematographer Laurie Rose made a spontaneous decision to film in black and white. Wheatley and Rose watched Culloden (film)|Culloden and other films by Peter Watkins, as well as arthouse films from the 1960s and 1970s, to explore the style. The pair experimented with camera tests before filming A Field in England and committed to the "unfussy" style.  With a production budget of £300,000,  filming began in late September 2012.  It took place in the countryside outside Guildford in Surrey. Filming lasted for  . 

==Release==

A Field in England screened in competition at the 48th Karlovy Vary International Film Festival on   2013,   and the film won a special jury prize.  It was released in the United Kingdom on   2013 through several platforms simultaneously.  The Hollywood Reporter said, "A Field in England will mark the first time a homegrown title has been released simultaneously in theaters, on DVD, free TV and video-on-demand." The film had received funding from the BFI Distribution Fund New Models strand, "which supports experimental release models". Film4 and its arms 4DVD and Film4 Channel collaborated with distributor Picturehouse Entertainment and with the BFI Distribution Fund for the rollout.    Wheatley compared the multi-platform release to how the band Radiohead released its album In Rainbows for free. 

Drafthouse Films acquired the rights to distribute the film in North America.  It partnered with Cinedigm in September 2013, and they released the film on 6 February 2014 on various platforms and formats. 

For the cinema release of A Field in England in the UK, Weltons Brewery brewed a limited edition ale to give to cinema-goers. The beer had the tagline "Open Up and Let the Devil In" to tie into the use of hallucinogens in the film. The ale was bottled with yeast, which required a slow pour to ensure "continuous secondary fermentation" for the beer to be fresh. 

==Reception==

The film received generally favourable reviews. On film aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, it has a 88% rating, with an average score of 7.4/10, based on reviews from 49 critics.  It has a score of 75/100 (indicating "generally favorable reviews") on Metacritic, based on reviews from 16 critics.  Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian wrote that A Field in England was a "grisly and visceral" film that was "exposed to the elements, shivering with fever and discomfort". Bradshaw said that Wheatley has "cleverly alighted on the one period that suits his stripped-down visuals and subversive instincts perfectly".    Jonathan Romney of The Independent wrote that the film was Wheatleys "most unclassifiable yet, blending historical drama, 1960s psychedelia and formal experimentation". He said, "Flawed as it is, A Field in England is some achievement, drumming up an earthly inferno out of next to nothing—dirt and wind, a patch of land, some blokes with scraggy beards. The result, in a minor-key fashion, is a blast—Apocalypse Now among the hedgerows."

===Writing===
 Straw Dogs and Withnail and I.  The Independent s Romney said, "The screenplay contains much juicy period dialogue, although the gist is often lost amid hectic cuts, drunken camera moves and the mens habit of grabbing each other by the throat." For Romney, "the sharpest moments of clarity" in the narrative came in the dialogue.  The Hollywood Reporter s Dalton wrote, "One of the films pleasures is its rich dialogue—a ripe blend of Shakespearean finery, salty swearing and lowbrow toilet humor." The trade paper noted, "Jump sets up some interesting tensions between Christian faith and Pagan witchcraft, science and sorcery, soldiers and scholars." 

===Cinematography===

The Guardian wrote that "the monochrome images" were similar to those of the 1975 film Winstanley (film)|Winstanley.  The Independent said the photography had "furious visual panache and... ominous, often abstract beauty".  The Hollywood Reporter commended the "terrific" cinematography of "ravishing monochrome vistas punctuated by extreme close-ups of plants, animals, insects and tormented human faces".  Variety wrote, "The commitment to monochrome brings out a beauty largely absent in previous collaborations with d.p. Laurie Rose, though his handheld style and axis-breaking setups often disorient—and not necessarily in ways that help the psychic imbalance the pic means to achieve." 

===Cast and characters===

The Guardian wrote, "Smiley is a great ONeil, scary and commanding, while Shearsmiths Whitehead is hilariously submissive." It added about Shearsmiths role, "His performance here is equal to and better than the gothic characters he has created on television.  Variety also commended Shearsmiths performance as leaving "the strongest impression". The trade paper expressed disappointment at a general lack of character development, "Although Wheatley and Jump have gotten away with eliminating exposition and traditional character detail in the past, its frustratingly difficult to follow what this motley group is searching for, much less to distinguish between the various personalities." 

===Editing===

Ben Wheatley and Amy Jump edited the film together. Variety said the editors "hypnotize the audience by cutting back and forth between shots of the various characters, folding and mirroring the images into disconcerting hallucinations".  The Independent wrote that the editors "big firework display" was that of a psychedelic experience, which was "a stroboscopic pandemonium of mirror images, flash cuts, bursts of light". 

===Music and sound===

The Hollywood Reporter said, "Sound designer Martin Pavey and composer Jim Williams also deserve special mention for underpinning these ostensibly calm pastoral scenes with a constant undertow of clanging, churning menace."  The Independent commended Paveys work, "Everything floats unmoored, dialogue has the same sonic status as the wind or the eerie music."
