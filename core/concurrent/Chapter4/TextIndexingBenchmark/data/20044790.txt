A skinny high school sophomore dreams up a science project that will make him a living legend, and win him the heart of a pretty senior who sees his true potential. Michael Peck is the kid nobody sees while hes walking down the hall. But when popular senior Emily takes a liking to Michael, he starts to become a little less invisible. Meanwhile, Michaels well meaning yet misguided parents pressure him to enter the upcoming science fair - an event that could land him right back in the land of misfits.
