}} film of the same name, both based on the 1964 novel The Flight of the Phoenix, by Elleston Trevor, about a group of people who survive an aircraft crash in the Gobi Desert and must build a new aircraft out of the old one to escape. The film stars Dennis Quaid and Giovanni Ribisi. Flight of the Phoenix opened in the U.S. on December 17. The film was a box-office failure, and received generally mixed reviews; criticism was geared toward its similarity to the 1965 film, while praise related to the acting, direction, and visuals.

==Plot== oil rig Kirk Jones) as well as the crew (Liddle, Kelly, Rady, A.J., Ian, Rodney, Davis, Sammi, Kyle, Newman and Dr. Gerber) are sent to shut down the operation. However, en route to Beijing, a major dust storm disables one engine, forcing them to crash land their Fairchild C-119 Flying Boxcar|C-119 Flying Boxcar in an uncharted area of the desert. Their cargo consists of used parts and tools from the rig, the rigs crew, and Elliot, a stow-away. The crash kills Dr. Gerber and Newman. Kyle, falls to his death. When the dust storm ends, it becomes apparent that they are 200 miles off course with only a months supply of water. Jeremy thinks about walking to get help, but Rady explains that July is the hottest in the Gobi, and that he wont make it.

In the middle of the night, Davis goes out to urinate without informing anybody, trips, gets lost in a sandstorm, and dies. The group panics after a failed search for him, and Kelly argues with Frank, who says that walking out of the desert would fail and that their only option is to await rescue. The group initially agrees but reconsiders after Elliot, claiming to be an aeronautical engineer, pitches a radical idea: rebuild the wreckage of their C-119 into a functional aircraft. Frank initially refuses, which causes Liddle to wander off on his own in protest. Frank attempts to find him. He comes across a valley littered with debris, cargo from the aircraft, which dropped out when the tail was torn open. Among the debris he discovers the bullet-ridden and stripped body of Kyle. Liddle says he will only go back with him if they build the plane, and Frank agrees.
 legendary bird. A problem evolves when a group of smugglers camp nearby; when the survivors attempt to communicate, the bandits kill Rodney, but they are killed in a short, fierce skirmish when ambushed by Frank. Later, it is revealed that Elliots aircraft design experience has been restricted to the design of model aircraft, much to the anger of everyone, especially Ian, who almost kills Elliot. However, they eventually are able to construct the new aircraft and take off, barely in time to escape a larger group of bandits seeking revenge for the murdered smugglers.

Through a series of photos, we see what became of the crew when they made it back to civilization. All have been revitalized by the experience: Frank and A.J. start their own airline (appropriately named Phoenix Aviation), Sammi and his wife start their own restaurant (Jeremy and Rady are there to celebrate), Liddle is reunited with his wife and kids, Ian becomes a professional golfer, Kelly is working at an ocean oil rig, and Elliot is wearing a flight suit on a  s New Hope?"

==Production==
Director John Moore scouted locations in Morocco and Australia before looking at, and quickly choosing,  , December 17, 2004. Retrieved: October 3, 2010.   The   could be maintained. 

The set was the site of several mishaps:
* A ferry sank during transportation of a major set piece across a river, forcing the river bottom salvage of the aircraft fuselage. 
* Jared Padalecki flipped his vehicle.    
* Concluding the aerial filming sequences, the flying Fairchild C-119 Flying Boxcar|C-119G N15501 suffered a long gash under the right wing when a film truck backed under it and its driver misjudged the trucks height. A repair crew was flown in, the damaged segment reskinned and the aircraft flown back across the Atlantic. 
* On June 3, 2004, camera operator and second unit cinematographer Ciaran Barry was "filming behind a plywood barrier intended to protect his equipment" when an 800-pound "fiberglass model plane propelled down an elevated track, bounced off a sand dune in the Namibian desert and crashed into his hut." Xianzhi, Li.   xinhuanet.com, October 14, 2009. Retrieved: October 3, 2010. 

For the latter, in October 2009 a Los Angeles jury awarded Barry $3.95 million in damages for broken legs and neurological damage he received during the accident; $1.3 million of the amount was awarded for lost future income. 

Four aircraft were used during the film:
*Fairchild C-119G, N15501 - flying shots. (still flying as of 2007, now part of the Lauridsen Collection at the Buckeye Municipal Airport, February 2010. ) Fairchild C-119F, BuNo.131700 / N3267U - desert wreck.
*Fairchild C-119F, BuNo.131691 - Phoenix film prop.
*Fairchild C-119F, BuNo.131706 - Phoenix film prop.
A Phoenix that could be taxied but not flown was built for closeups. The Phoenix in flying scenes were done using a radio-controlled model and computer graphics.

==Reception==
Flight of the Phoenix has received generally mixed reviews from critics. On   of The New York Times said the film is a "rickety update of the far superior 1965 movie" that "throws in every cheap trick in the manual to pump up your heartbeat   is so manipulative that the involuntary jolts of adrenaline it produces make you feel like a fool."  Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film two stars, writing "Im not recommending it for those who know the original, but it might work nicely enough for those who have not (seen it)." 

The film did receive some praise. Scott Brown from Entertainment Weekly gave the film a B grade, saying "refreshingly, its actually about action, albeit arbitrary action, and how it defines us and keeps us alive."  Kevin Thomas of the Los Angeles Times gave the film four stars out of five, calling it "a worthy remake."
