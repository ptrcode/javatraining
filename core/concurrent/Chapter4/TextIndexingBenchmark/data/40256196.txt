 Jim McBrides David Holzmans Diary. 

Critical reception was mixed. Life (magazine)|Life reviewer Richard Schickel praised Torns performance, Ginsbergs inventive use of camera and sound, and the "illuminating" portrayal of a schizophrenic breakdown.  Critic Andrew Sarris gave it a less favorable review, however, and the film was a commercial failure.

The film has since attained a cult following among critics and filmmakers.
