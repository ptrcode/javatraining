La morte accarezza a mezzanotte marks the third collaboration between director Luciano Ercoli and screenwriter Ernesto Gastaldi, who had previously worked together on 1971s La morte cammina con i tacchi alti and 1970s Le foto proibite di una signora per bene.    Ercolis wife Nieves Navarro, credited here as Susan Scott, featured in several of his other films, often in similar roles as "tough, independent" women.  The directors preference for this type of character has been noted as being inspired by fumetti, a form of Italian photonovel often featuring such roles. 

== Release ==
 
La morte accarezza a mezzanotte (Translation: Death Caresses at Midnight) was released in Italy on 17 November 1972.  It has also been distributed under the titles Muerte acaricia a medianoche   Film & TV Database   La morte accarezza a mezzanotte |publisher=British Film Institute |accessdate=17 June 2012}}  and Death Walks at Midnight. It was released under the latter title in English by NoShame Films as part of a box set with La morte cammina con i tachi alti, titled Luciano Ercolis Death Box Set. 

== Reception ==

Writing for Allmovie, Robert Firsching gave the film one star out of five, calling it "laughably camp fun".    Writing for DVD Talk, Stuart Galbraith described the film as having "an exciting knock-down, drag-out climax". Reviewing the film alongside La morte cammina i tachi alti, Galbraith felt that La morte accarezza a mezzanotte had "a stronger, less-predictable screenplay   a bit more visual flair" than its companion film; he ultimately rated both films together three-and-a-half stars out of five.
