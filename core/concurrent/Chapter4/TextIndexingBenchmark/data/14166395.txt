==Plot==
 

Lazar Perkov or Laki is an orthopaedic specialist at the State Hospital in Skopje. His mother, Dr. Vera Perkova is the Orthopaedic clinics director.

The action begins at Lazars home where he has a fight with his wife about how messed up his life was. Pissed off from the fight, he goes for a drive. When trying to light a cigarette in his car, without having the seatbelt on, his phone rings — it is his mother. Then the cigarette falls from his mouth in the desperate attempt to grab his mobile phone on the seat next to him, burning him on the arm. Now he loses control over the car, but meanwhile a woman is crossing the road. Lazars attempt to avoid hitting her is fatal. His car flips, and crashes until he is found hanging off the cars window whose glass had broken in the crash. The slow movement on the car resting off a buildings wall is threatening to crush his dangling head. As all of the people on the streets watch in despair, something moves him away from the car.
