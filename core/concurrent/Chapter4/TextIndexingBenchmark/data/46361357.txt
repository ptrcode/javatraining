Set in a village, a young Brahmin couple Nandlal (Mumtaz Ali) and Uma (Devika Rani)	are unable to have any children. The husband plans to take another wife, Padma. Ramu (Kishore Sahu) belongs to the potters family where Uma normally spent most of her time before marriage. The friendship has been frowned upon as Ramu is from the Harijan caste. Nandlal sends Uma to her fathers house, where she renews her friendship with Ramu. Nandlal sees Uma talking to Ramu (Kishore Sahu). While at her fathers house, Uma discovers that she is pregnant. Misunderstandings arise when Nandlal gets suspicious about Uma and Ramu, but all is set right by Padma, Nandlals second wife.

==Review==
 
Jeevan Prabhat was released on 2 November 1937, at Minerva Talkies, Bombay. Baburao Patel, the Filmindia editor, in his review of December 1937, called it Ostens "better work than ever before". Saraswati Devis music composition and Wirschings cinematography were praised, as was Niranjan Pals screenplay, "a good story with plenty of entertainment". Devika Rani was hailed for scoring "another triumphant". Renuka Devi was praised for her looks but criticised for her acting. Kishore Sahu was stated to be a "big disappointment".   

The audience reception was good with the film running for over 17 weeks in Bombay, while doing good business in the rest of the country too, becoming a commercial success.   

==Production==
The film starred Ashok Kumar with Devika Rani, who was cited as a "bankable star".    Bombay Talkies was producing a large quantity of films in a short period of time. Jeevan Prabhat was completed in two months, while Achhut Kanya was made in six weeks.    In a little over four years, Osten had directed about sixteen films for Bombay Talkies.
