Raja Mukthi ( ) is a Tamil language film starring M. K. Thyagaraja Bhagavathar, V. N. Janaki and Bhanumathi Ramakrishna|P. Bhanumathi in the lead roles. M. G. Ramachandran had done a supporting role. The film was released on 9 October 1948. 

==Production==
M. K. Thyagaraja Bhagavathar produced this movie himself under his banner Narendra Picture. He had done so in order to avoid to shoot the movie in Madras city where he had been imprisoned for more than 2 years. He booked Prabhat Studios in Poona and took on lease a bungalow to accommodate his cast. Most of the technicianns are from Prabhat Studious.

==Plot==
King Rajendra Varman and Queen Mrinalini are reigning the Vyjayanti empire. Mahendra Varman is the rival and the neighbouring king. Kannika is the minister’s daughter, who is in love with King Rajendra Varman and aims to attain him at any cost.

This convoluted tale of palace intrigue, suspicion, unreciprocated love, seduction, villainy and piety was interspersed with excellent music.
