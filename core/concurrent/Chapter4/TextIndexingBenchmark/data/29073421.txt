==Critical response==
 
Film Threat found potential in the film, writing, "There is a great film in the first half of Jordan Harris and Andrew Schraders Fever Night", making special note that "the films set up is brilliant", but they felt the potential was not fully met.     In a positive review, Quiet Earth wrote, "Theres enough material, visually and semantically, in there to get you brain fried and scrambled, and leave you with a stupid contented face for hours."    Fatally-Yours stated that they were so impressed with the film that they were initially at a loss for words and found it difficult to express the emotions engendered after having watched it.    Fangoria wrote that the films subtitle, Band of Satanic Outsiders was a favorite that "howls that this film is full of fun Mephistopilean escapades!".     The Movies Made Me reviewer stated that he was "never big on the overly psychedelic style of film", but that the trailer "looked like it had a lot of fun to offer" and after having watched the film he found no reason to regret having done so, as the psychedelic aspects were selectively used.  Though he stated the acting was better than expected, he faulted the films pacing in the last 30 minutes.   10,000 Bullets wrote that, from a production standpoint, "just about every aspect of Fever Night is pitch perfect. The direction is stylish, the films ambient sounds capes are superbly realized and the acting fare exceeded my expectations," but by the films finale, it began "to lose its way".   At BadMovieRealm.com, Derek Miller wrote that the film has style and atmosphere, but the film seemed a bit disjointed and that the psychedelic effects sometimes distracted rather than added to atmosphere.  In summary, he wrote "To my surprise, Fever Night is actually a pretty entertaining film. As I said earlier, it definitely isnt a film which I wouldve normally sought out, but I am glad it was brought to my attention; the touching tribute to Deliverance notwithstanding."
