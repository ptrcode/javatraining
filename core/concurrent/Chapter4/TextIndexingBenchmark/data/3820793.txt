==Reception==

===Critical response===
When the film was released, film critic Bosley Crowther praised the work of actor John Garfield, writing: "John Garfields stark performance of the fugitive who desperately contrives to save himself briefly from capture is full of startling glints from start to end. He makes a most odd and troubled creature, unused to the normal flow of life, unable to perceive the moral standards of decent people or the tentative advance of a good girls love. And in Mr. Garfields performance, vis-a-vis the rest of the cast, is conveyed a small measure of the irony and the pity that was in the book." 

More recently, film critic Dennis Schwartz also wrote positively of Garfields performance, writing: "He Ran All the Way was the last film made by the brilliant John Garfield ... Garfield gives a terrific chilling performance as someone who is less like a cold-blooded killer than someone who has been rejected all his life by family and the outside world, and like a wounded animal goes on the run as a desperate man in search of someone to trust in this cold world."
