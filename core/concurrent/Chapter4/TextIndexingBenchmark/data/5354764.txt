==Film production and planned release==
  And the Halifax for its "final shoot." 
 Michael Donovan (Halifax), as well as Wayne Clarkson of Telefilm Canada, occurred in Montréal on June 2, 2006. 

In a special account of the filming published in the Toronto Star on 22 July 2006, David Thompson observes that the actor Roy Dupuis "looks eerily like Dallaire, sporting a carefully groomed moustache, summer tan uniform and authentic blue beret":
 Indeed, Dupuis is even wearing Dallaires original army nametag and decorations from 1994.  Dallaire is collaborating on this project – right down to a line-by-line review of the script – and insisted on giving Dupuis the decorations to add authenticity.  He also gave Dupuis something of himself. "I feel a real connection with this man. He opened up to me," Dupuis says during an interview on the set, the first time he has spoken with media since the gruelling shoot began in Rwanda a month ago.  "Im here because of him."  ("One Last Dance with the Devil") 

In "New Rwanda Genocide Movie Criticizes U.N. Role," first posted on Reuters on August 9, 2006, Arthur Asiimwe quotes from his interview in Kigali with the films director Roger Spottiswoode:
 "Our film is about a man who was aware genocide was coming and tried to get the U.N. to allow him to do something about it, but . . . instead it turned him down. . . .  It is really about the bigger issue of what the U.N. role is in situations like these," he told Reuters at the capitals Amahoro stadium, which sheltered thousands of terrified residents in 1994 as the killers roamed the streets outside.  
Spottiswoode said the film was particularly timely given the calls on the United Nations to intervene to end the war in Lebanon, and the ongoing efforts to send a U.N. force to stop rampant murders and rapes in Sudans troubled Darfur region.  The United States has called the Darfur conflict genocide.

According to Marie-Chantal Fiset, in her interview with Jean-Guy Plante published on August 27, 2006, "J’ai serré la main du diable, en version française, devrait sortir en salle en octobre 2007."  (The French version of the film, entitled Jai serré la main du diable, will open in movie theaters in October 2007.)
