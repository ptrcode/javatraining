 NBA star Ray Allen. Jake is released on parole for a week by the states governor to persuade his son to play for the governors alma mater, in exchange for a much reduced prison sentence. This is the third of four film collaborations with Washington and Lee.

Filming took place between July and September 1997. Locations included Coney Island, Brooklyn, Cabrini&ndash;Green|Cabrini&ndash;Green housing projects in Chicago, Illinois, Elon University, North Carolina, and Los Angeles, California.

==Plot== Lincoln High School in Coney Island, Brooklyn, New York, is being pursued by the top college basketball programs in the nation. His father, Jake (Denzel Washington), is a convicted felon serving time at Attica Correctional Facility for accidentally killing his wife (Jesus mother) by pushing her while arguing with Jesus at the age of 12. The father is temporarily released by the governor, an influential alum of "Big State," one of the colleges Jesus is considering, so that he might persuade his son to sign with the governors college; if successful hell get an early release from prison.

While seemingly a sound plan, it turns haywire due to the strained relationship between Jesus and his father. Upon his first moments outside of prison, Jake contacts his daughter Mary Shuttlesworth (Zelda Harris), who is happy to see him. Mary invites her father to the apartment where she and Jesus now live, having moved out of their Uncle Bubbas place. When Jesus returns home from school, he is unhappy to see his father. Refusing to look him in the eye, he tells his sister to get rid of the "stranger" in their living room. Jesus later agrees to meet with his father at an alternative location away from Mary. Throughout the movie, Jake tries to persuade Jesus to attend "Big State" with seemingly no success. Eventually he divulges the deal set up by the governor, but Jesus appears unsympathetic to his fathers situation.

Intertwined with the story of the Shuttlesworth family is the sub-plot of Dakota Barns (Milla Jovovich), a prostitute who stays in the room next to Jake in the run-down hotel which the warden has booked for him. Dakota is being abused by her current boss/lover and Jake overhears their violence through the thin walls. Throughout the movie Jake is seen helping clean her wounds, and he (Jake) gave her some of his money to be used for his expenses during this week out of prison. Dakota is seen in one of the final scenes of the movie taking a Greyhound bus away from New York City.

Jesus is tempted with offers of cash and women on recruiting visits to big time basketball programs.  He also considers declaring the NBA in order to play professionally sooner and immediately lift himself and his sister out of poverty. Ultimately, Jesus decides to sign to play for "Big State" but not until after his fathers deadline. Jake gets no relief on his sentence.

===Critical response=== Malcolm X. He was particularly encouraged by Lees determination not to adhere to typical conventions.   

Both Ray Allen and Washington drew praise for their performances,  with Roger Ebert writing that Allen "is that rarity, an athlete who can act," and Slate magazine writing that Washingtons performance was "gorgeously underplayed".  

ESPNs review pointed out factual flaws in the story: "...coaches arent allowed to discuss potential recruits until after the signing period. Come on, Spike. (And while were at it, players arent allowed to visit a college one week before the signing deadline; Jesus couldnt live alone with his sister without both of them being thrown in a foster home; and theres NO WAY IN HELL that Jesus wouldnt have just turned pro if he was that good and that broke.)"
