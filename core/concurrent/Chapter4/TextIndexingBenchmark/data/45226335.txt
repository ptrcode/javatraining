==Reviews==
In Ambiciosa, Meche Barba is a young woman that climbs the ladder of the film industry through false and empty relationships. Somehow, portraying a sordid secret item and recognized in the film room. It is a curious and interesting film, made at the end of a filmography that Barba unexpectedly cut the following year.    Meche Barba is amazing as a great villain in her performance, but who steals camera is the singer and actor Fernando Fernandez, who in the sequence where calls Barba for abandoning him, it does dramatically.
