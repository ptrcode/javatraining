El chevrolé is a 1999 Uruguayan film.   

==General information==
Its plot is based on the novel El regreso del gran Tuleque by Mauricio Rosencof. 

The film is named based on the mispronounced name of an authentic Chevrolet car, transformed into a peddler car, which appears on the main scenes. 

A very important musical feature are the tamboril (percussion)|tamboriles. Other meaningful music tunes heard in the soundtrack are from El Peyote Asesino, La Abuela Coca, Plátano Macho, and Hot Jam Band. 

The postproduction of the sound was performed at Twickenham Film Studios, which gave the film an unparallelled sound quality as compared with other Uruguayan films.
