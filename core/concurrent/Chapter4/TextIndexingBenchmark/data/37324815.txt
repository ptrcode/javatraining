Exit 33 is a 2011 horror film directed by Tommy Brunswick, and written by Mark Myers and Norman Koza.

== Plot ==

While drunk and out hunting one day, Ike accidentally shot his pregnant wife in the eye, and since then he has been coerced by hallucinations or ghosts of his wife and unborn son into atoning for the act by acquiring replacement eyes. Whenever a woman he finds suitable stops at his gas station on Exit 33, Ike has them use a sabotaged pump that causes their vehicle to break down a short distance away. Ike then drives up, kills anyone with the woman, knocks her out and takes her back to the gas station, where he gouges out their eyes, and makes jerky out of their body. Ike preserves the eyes, and places them in one of the mounted hunting trophies in his den.

While on their way to their fifth high school reunion, Angie and Eve (whose boyfriend is beheaded with a hacksaw) are captured by Ike, who removes both of Eves eyes and lets her Exsanguination|exsanguinate. Every time a possible savior (such as Angies boyfriend Matt, a pair of hunters, and an off-duty police officer) stop by, they are killed by Ike, who loses an eye himself during a fight with Matt. Angies eyes are inevitably removed, and Ike places them in one of his hunting trophies. While relaxing in his den, Ike tells his imaginary son that he hopes next hunting season will be just as fruitful as this one.

== Reception ==

About gave Exit 33 a one out of five, calling it "clich√©-ridden torture porn drivel" that suffered from repetitiveness, poor acting and flat characters.  A one and half ("Not Good, Hardcore Only") was given by Best Horror Movies.  Full Moon Reviews stated that while the film had potential and Kane Hodder and the gore were good, it was still a disappointment, with a boring story, limp direction and hit and miss acting.  Exit 33 was called mediocre by Horror Movie a Day, which said that it was "too repetitive and bland to really register" and "another pointless horror flick no one will remember in five years". 

Horror Chronicles said the film was not that bad, while Oh, The Horror! found it watchable, despite deeming it "pretty below average".
