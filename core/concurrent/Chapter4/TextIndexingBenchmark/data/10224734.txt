==Reception==

===Critical response===
When the film was released Ronnie Scheib, film critic at Variety (magazine)|Variety magazine, gave the film a mixed review, writing, "A weird hodgepodge, Proud is part history lesson, part family saga, a lyrical nod to the Old Sod, a Navy recruitment flag-waver and a war actioner. Earnest, intermittently rousing pic, skedded for a fall opening, should coast on Davis masterful perf before being archived by cable for suitable occasions...Pics overall structure is determined both by Davis narration and by the presence of black war correspondent Thomas Young (Darnell Williams), who was assigned to cover the Mason. His frequent to-the-camera interviews with sailors abstractly punctuate the film, creating a broader sociological framework...Aside from generally excellent combat scenes, pic is uneven. The bigoted animosity of a petty officer, for instance, or the Admiraltys dismissal of the captains praise of his crews valor as exaggeration unfold with the leaden sententiousness of a grade-school pageant." 

Critic Marcia Davis with The Washington Post wrote, "The high purpose of Proud is not matched by the films execution, however. Its worth seeing, but dont go expecting a traditional Hollywood feature film. It is rather oddly executed and uneven, unlike the well-known and controversial Glory (1989 film)|Glory, which won Denzel Washington his first Oscar, or the brilliant A Soldiers Story, adapted from Charles Fullers A Soldiers Play. Proud is something of a hybrid, part documentary -- with actual footage from the Mason -- and part dramatization. It is at times deeply poignant when it talks about the longing of black men to be treated as men and what they went through to prove their worthiness. It can also be a bit of an unrestrained flag-waver on black American patriotism."
