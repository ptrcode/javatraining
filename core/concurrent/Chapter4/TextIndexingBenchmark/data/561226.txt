Risky Business is a 1983 American    It covers themes including materialism, loss of innocence, coming of age and capitalism.

==Plot== North Shore area of suburban Chicago. His father wants him to attend Princeton University, so Joels mother tells him to tell the interviewer, Bill Rutherford, about his participation in Future Enterprisers, an extracurricular activity in which students work in teams to create small businesses.

When his parents go away on a trip, Joel is left with explicit instructions not to touch the stereo system and not to use his fathers beloved Porsche. Joels friend, Miles (Curtis Armstrong), convinces him to take advantage of his newfound freedom to have some fun. On the first night, he raids the liquor cabinet, plays the stereo loudly, and dances around the living room in his underpants, socks, and pink dress shirt to "Old Time Rock and Roll". Later, he and his friend Barry (Bronson Pinchot) take the Porsche out and drive it recklessly.
 call girl named Jackie on Joels behalf despite his frustrated objections. Jackie (Bruce A. Young) turns out to be a tall, masculine Transvestism|transvestite. Joel reluctantly pays Jackie most of the money his parents gave him, but before Jackie leaves, he gives Joel the number for Lana, another prostitute, promising that shes "what every white boy off the lake wants".

That night, Joel has a nightmare of his house being covered by squad cars and the police arresting him for statutory rape as his friends and family watch in horror. Jostled awake, Joel hesitantly calls Lana (Rebecca De Mornay). She turns out to be a gorgeous blonde and they have sex all night. The following morning, Lana asks Joel for $300 for her services. Having no money in the house, he goes to the bank, but when he returns, Lana is gone, along with his mothers expensive Steuben crystal egg. Joel and Miles find Lana at a restaurant and demand the egg back, but they are interrupted by Lanas pimp, Guido (Joe Pantoliano), who pulls a gun. Joel (in his fathers Porsche 928 ) is chased by Guido, but manages to escape.

The next morning, Lana tells Joel that the egg is with the rest of her stuff at Guidos. Joel lets Lana stay at his house while he goes to school. When he returns, his friends are over, and Lana has invited another prostitute, Vicki (Shera Danese), to stay. Later, Lana mentions to Joel that his friends should collaborate with her friends to make money. Joel rejects the idea.

That night, Joel, Lana, Vicki, and Barry go out. They get Effects of cannabis|stoned, and while Vicky and Barry wander away, Joel and Lana talk. Lana takes offense to something Joel says and leaves. While retrieving her purse from Joels car, she inadvertently moves the shifter out of gear.  Moments later, the car rolls down the hill and onto a pier, despite Joels futile attempt to stop it.  The car miraculously stops at the piers edge and Joel breathes a heavy sigh of relief, but moments later the pier collapses, dumping Joel and the Porsche into Lake Michigan. Joel takes the car to a repair shop and is horrified to learn how much it will cost to fix it.

Arriving tardy to school, Joel realizes his lateness will cause him to fail two midterms. He attempts to explain his situation to the school nurse but is coldly rebuffed. He grabs the nurse by the collar and calmly demands compassion. Following this, Joel is suspended from school for five days and kicked out of Future Enterprisers. He goes to see Lana, who decides to turn the Goodsons house into a brothel for a night; Joels share of the profits will pay for the car repairs.
 Wayfarers and joyously exclaims, "Looks like University of Illinois!"  Afterwards, Rutherford stays at the party and becomes acquainted with Lanas friends. After the party, Joel and Lana go and have sex on the deserted Chicago L train.

The next morning, Joel finds his house has been Burglary|burgled. When he tries to call Lana, Guido answers; he tells Joel that he will let him buy back his furniture.  Later that day, Guido delivers the vanload of furniture to the house and Joel buys it all back, the final piece being the glass egg.  Guidos female associate Vicki (who has clearly double-crossed Joel; left unclear is how much Lana participated in the burglary) tosses the egg like a football and Joel manages to catch it just before it hits the ground.  Deal now closed, Guido leaves and Joel and his friends manage to get everything moved back in the house just as his parents walk in, though his mother notices a crack in her egg.  Joel eventually accepts responsibility and goes out to rake the yard.  His father comes up to him and excitedly informs Joel that Rutherford was satisfied with the interview and said "Princeton could use a guy like Joel".

Joel meets Lana at a restaurant, and they speculate about their future. She tells him that she wants to keep on seeing him; he jokes that it will cost her. In a final voiceover, Joel reveals that, for Future Enterprisers, he "deals in human fulfillment" and has "grossed over $8000 in one night". He ends by quoting Guido: "Time of your life, huh kid?"

===Original ending===

After test screenings, David Geffen, the head of the studio, insisted that director Paul Brickman shoot a more upbeat ending for the film. The upbeat studio ending ordered by Geffen was used in the original theatrical release.  The remastered 25th-anniversary DVD edition offers "both the upbeat studio ending and Mr. Brickmans original, more tentative and melancholic conclusion".  In the melancholic ending, while Joel is still accepted into Princeton, the film ends on an ambiguous note. Joel and Lana ponder the future and Joel then asks Lana if their "night together" was all a setup. Lana denies this, but it is clear that Joel has difficulty believing Lana and states that he does not want her to get hurt, to which Lana exclaims in frustration, "Why does it have to be so tough?" Joel asks Lana for her embrace, and she embraces him reluctantly. The scene and film conclude not with the quote from Guido, but with the voiced-over line, "Isnt life grand?"

==Reception==
Risky Business received critical acclaim by critics. It is also considered by many as one of the best films of 1983.     Janet Maslin, in her 1983 review of the film for The New York Times, called it "part satire, part would-be suburban poetry and part shameless showing off" and said the film "shows an abundance of style", though "you would be hard pressed to find a film whose heros problems are of less concern to the world at large."  She called De Mornay "disarming as a call girl who looks more like a college girl" and credits Cruise with making "Joels transformation from straight arrow to entrepreneur about as credible as it can be made."

Ebert continued: 

 The very best thing about the movie is its dialogue. Paul Brickman, who wrote and directed, has an ear so good that he knows what to leave out. This is one of those movies where a few words or a single line says everything that needs to be said, implies everything that needs to be implied, and gets a laugh. When the hooker tells the kid, "Oh, Joel, go to school, go learn something," the precise inflection of those words defines their relationship for the next three scenes. 

Variety (magazine)|Variety said the film was like a "promising first novel, with all the pros and cons that come with that territory" and complimented Brickman on "the stylishness and talent of his direction."  The film holds a 98% "Certified Fresh" rating on the review aggregate website Rotten Tomatoes. 

==Legacy==
In 2006, the film was #40 on Entertainment Weekly s list of the 50 Best High School Movies. The magazine called the film a "sharp satire of privileged suburban teens" about the "soul-crushing pressure to be perfect."  

In the years since the films release, the scene featuring Cruises character dancing in his pink dress shirt and briefs to "Old Time Rock and Roll" by Bob Seger has been seen in episodes of many television series, films, and advertisements.
