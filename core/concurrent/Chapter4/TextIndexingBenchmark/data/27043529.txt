}} David Greene Hardingham Mill on the River Yare in Norfolk. 

==Plot==
Susannah Kelton, a newly married twentysomething who was raised in foster care in the big city, learns that her real parents have only recently died and left all of their property to her.  She and her husband, Mike, travel to the island of Dunwich off the coast of Massachusetts to inspect the property.  They find a local culture that is clannish, backward and ignorant.  The few friends they make amongst the locals, including Susannahs Aunt Agatha, warn them that the family mill is cursed and urge the Keltons to leave immediately and never look back.  Refusing to bow to superstition, the Keltons consider rehabilitating the abandoned mill.  They become the target of a gang of local thugs led by Susannahs lecherous cousin, Ethan.  Their reign of terror is ended by something still living in the shuttered attic room of the mill, something that caused Susannah nightmares as a child.
