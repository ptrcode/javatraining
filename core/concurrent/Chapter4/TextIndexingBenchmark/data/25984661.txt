==Critical reception==
 , and it works in Get Out Your Handkerchiefs|Préparez Les Mouchoirs, but something went wrong in his sexual extravaganza Calmos (and the picture failed, even in France)...The two men are joined by other escaping men; women demanding gratification come after them with guns, and its a full-scale tedious war of the sexes until, finally, the two pals, old men now and shrivelled in size, are dropped out of a cloud onto an island...Calmos is an overscaled back-to-the-womb satiric fantasy - a male daydream about the impossibility of escape from the sexual wars..Its about the demands of sex on men who spent their youth chasing women and now - jaded - want a break from it - they want to go off and live like pigs. Its a funny idea, and though Calmos abandons it, there are still things to look at all through the picture...Throughout the women are made repellently beautiful - they have a neon voraciousness. Brigitte Fossey, a blond cat with a perfect tiny mouth, is like sensual porcelain. No one but Blier has matched such raunchiness and such visual beauty; you have to have a true respect for raunchiness to do that."
