Set in the Ligurian Riviera during the 1980s, it features Paolo Villaggio as Ugo Maria Volpone, a rich but apparently ill ship company owner. He is surrounded by a series of relatives and friends (played by Enrico Maria Salerno, Renzo Montagnani, Alessandro Haber) who blandish him in order to inherit his estate. The shrewd Volpone, in return, organizes a hoax against them to betray their greed. In the movie, he his joined by a new waiter, Bartolomeo Mosca (Enrico Montesano), who quickly shows himself to be as cunning as Volpone in arranging humiliations.
