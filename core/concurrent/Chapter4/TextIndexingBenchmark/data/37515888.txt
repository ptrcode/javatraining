== Plot ==

== Production ==
Birdemic 2 was announced in April 2011, along with news that Bagh would reprise his role from the first film.   Production began on February 4, 2012.   Nguyen included long scenes of dancing in order to satisfy fans of his first film, who he said wanted romantic content; Nguyen himself sees the film as a romantic thriller.  Nguyen was influenced by concerns about global warming, which he said was the cause of the bird and zombie attacks in the film.   The film was shot in 3D, which Nguyen said he mastered during shooting.   Shooting in 3D slowed down production, but Nguyen said he believed it would bring more people to the sequel. 

== Release ==
A tie-in video game was released in October 2012.   Starting on April 16, 2013, Chill.com exclusively offered the film via video on demand for 90 days before it was released to other services.   It was released on DVD in October 2013. 

== Reception ==
Dennis Harvey of   wrote, "What keeps Birdemic 2 from reaching the first films level of fun is Nguyens penchant for treating this go-round like a greatest-hits reel."   HorrorNews.Net rated it 0/5 stars and called it the worst film of the year.
