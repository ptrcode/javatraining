==Reception==

The movie was controversial.  At least one critic has suggested that the films glorification of drug dealers serves to subtly critique the civil rights movement’s failure to provide better economic opportunities for black America and that the portrayal of a black community controlled by drug dealers serves to highlight that the initiatives of the civil rights movement were far from fully accomplished. 

However the filmmakers maintain that it was their desire to show the negative and empty aspects of the drug subculture. This is evident in the movie from the beginning as Priest communicates his desire to leave the business.  Nearly every character in the film, with the notable exception of his " ," tries to dissuade Priest from quitting; their chief argument being that dealing and snorting are the best he ever could achieve in life.

The film was re-released in 1973 and earned $2 million in North American rentals.
