 Clyde Fitchs Regency dandy Beau Brummell.

This movie survives today in various edits, the original 135 minute release and 80 minute and 71 minute versions. The short versions usually cut Carmel Myers scenes.

A couple of years after Barrymores death, his daughter Diana Barrymore was shown a special screening of this film as she had never seen her father in any of his silent films. 
 public domain in the United States due to the failure of Warner Bros. (who were about to produce the Stewart Granger version) to renew the copyright registration in the 28th year after production.  This hasnt stopped WB from releasing an authorized DVD version (of a much superior quality print) through the Warner Archive MOD program.

==Plot==
In 1795, the cream of English aristocracy attend the wedding of "tradesmans daughter" Margery. She loves Beau Brummel, a penniless captain in the Tenth Hussars, but has been pressured into agreeing to marry Lord Alvanley, exchanging her familys wealth for social standing and a title. When Brummel comes to see her just before the wedding, she begs him to take her away, but her ambitious mother, Mrs. Wertham, intervenes, and Margery gives way. Embittered, Brummel decides to seek revenge against society using his "charm, wit and personal appearance".

At a dinner given by the Prince of Wales for the officers of his regiment, the Prince is attracted to Mrs. Snodgrass, the innkeepers wife. When Brummel rescues him from the irate husband, he takes a great liking to the captain, enabling Brummel to attach himself to His Royal Highness.

By 1811, Brummel has made his house in London the "rendezvous of the smart world" and himself the arbiter of fashion. When Lord Henry Stanhope catches him dallying with his infatuated wife, a duel ensues. Lord Henry misses, whereupon Brummel fires his pistol into the air. Afterward, however, Brummel informs Lady Hester Stanhope that he never loved her. She attracts the attention of the womanizing Prince.

She and another enemy he has made set out to turn the Prince against him. Brummel unwittingly helps them, having become too sure of his position; he is rude to his royal friend. Brummel turns his attentions to the Duchess of York, the Princes sister-in-law. She agrees to a late night private supper, but Lady Margery shows up first. She warns him that his enemies are hard at work; one knows about the rendezvous. The Prince arrives unannounced, expecting to find the Duchess, but is (pleasantly) surprised to find Lady Margery instead. When she rejects his initial advances, he offers to appoint Brummel the Ambassador to France. Lady Margery is delighted at the prospect, but it is all for naught. Shortly afterward, the two men quarrel openly, and neither is interested in a reconciliation.
 George IV, stops at Calais. In his entourage is Lady Margery. Both see Brummel standing by the side of the road.  Without his masters knowledge, Mortimer goes to see the King, pretending to represent Brummel in an effort to heal the breech. When Brummel finds out, he discharges Mortimer. Lady Margery comes to see Brummel in his garret. Her husband has died, and she asks him to marry her. He turns her down, saying he is too worn out and tired, perhaps even of love. After she departs, his resolution wavers, but he regains control of himself.

In old age, Brummel ends up in the hospital prison of Bon Saveur. The ever-faithful Mortimer visits him, but Brummels mind has deteriorated - he does not recognize his old servant at first. Mortimer informs him that the King has died and that Lady Margery is very ill. The scene shifts to the latters bed. Her spirit leaves her body and travels to Brummels cell. When Brummel also dies, their youthful souls are joyfully reunited.
