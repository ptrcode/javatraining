== Plot summary == Lord von Count Johann Oetsch appears. He gets eschewed by other partakers of the hunt since he is reputed to have shot his own brother, Paul Hartmann (actor)|Peter, a few years ago. This rumour gets nourished by a retired Judge of the District Court.
 Baroness Safferstätt, is also expected – which makes the situation unpleasant for the host. Count Oetsch neclects this matter and remains. The Baroness is affrighted by their coming and determined to depart again. The report of the coming of Father Faramund, allied with her former husband, is kept back by her; she will make confession unto him.
 Baron Safferstätt, a friend of her husband, had wished for something "evil" – which in turn had falsely interpreted it and thereafter shot her husband. This common trespass had finally let her and the Baron be married, without something else to feel for each other than emptiness.
 Father Faramund comes to the castle.
