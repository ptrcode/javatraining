Stasera niente di nuovo (literally: Tonight nothing is new) is an Italian 1942 Italian drama film directed by Mario Mattoli and starring Alida Valli.

==Plot==
Cesare, a journalist, recognizes among some prostitutes arrested by the police, the young woman that saved his life some time earlier, without his having learned her identity. He tries to help the woman, Maria, and convince her to change her life, but without success.

Later on, Maria asks Cesare for his help.  She is dying in a hospital, but cannot tell her parents, because, some time earlier, she had told them that she was married.  So, in the last hours of her life, Cesare marries Maria, and then calls for her family to be with her.

==The song “Ma l’amore no”==
In the movie, Alida Valli sings the song “Ma l’amore no” (by Galdieri and  DAnzi).  The song became very popular, and was played repeatedly on the radio in the last years of World War II, becoming a leitmotif of the 1940s for many Italians.  The song was reintroduced by Giuseppe Tornatore in his 2000 film Malèna, with Monica Bellucci.
