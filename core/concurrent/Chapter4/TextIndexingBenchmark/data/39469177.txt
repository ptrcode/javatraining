==Plot synopsis==

"Deputy" Baron (Dominic Purcell) leads four assassins to impersonate Secret Service agents in order to commandeer the house of Ellen (Erin Karpluk), which they plan to use to assassinate the President by sniper rifle on his visit to the small town of Suddenly, Washington. Baron and his men fool the local cops except for Deputy Todd Shaw (Ray Liotta), who is a washed-up former war hero who became the town drunk. Todd served with Ellens late husband in Iraq, and has developed romantic feelings for Ellen, who rebuffs his advances. Todd visits Ellens house and becomes suspicious of Baron, but no one will listen to the ravings of a drunk. The assassins cause Ellens father to die of a heart attack, but her young teenage son Pidge escapes the house to fetch help.  Once Todd discovers Barons plan, he does not bother calling it in, but does manage to kill one of Barons crew before he is captured. Two assassins chat with Todd and Ellen while waiting to execute the plan, leading to a revelation that Todd accidentally killed Ellens husband when reacting to a grenade attack on a moonless night in Iraq.  The third  assassin catches Pidge as he flags down local electrician Judd, bringing them both back to the house.  The electrician electrocutes the third assassin, and Baron kills his remaining partner for having second thoughts.  Todd jumps Baron, the lone surviving assassin, as he shoots at the President with a sniper rifle, causing him to only graze the Presidents arm.  Pidge shoots Baron as he is about to kill Todd.  Todd discovers that there was an unknown fifth conspirator communicating via text messages with Baron and his team.
