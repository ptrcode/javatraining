}} ensemble drama racial and social tensions carjacked outside a video store on Wilshire Boulevard in 1991. 
 black Los detective estranged white district attorney and his irritated, pampered wife; a racist white police officer who disgusts his more idealistic younger partner; an African American Hollywood director and his wife who must deal with the officer; a Iranian citizens abroad|Persian-immigrant father who is wary of others; and a hard-working Hispanic family man, a locksmith. The film differs from many other films about racism in its rather impartial approach to the issue. Rather than separating the characters into victims and offenders, victims of racism are often shown to be prejudiced themselves in different contexts and situations. Also, racist remarks and actions are often shown to stem from ignorance and misconception rather than a malicious personality.

==Plot==
Farhad, a Persian shop owner, and his daughter, Dorri, argue with a gun store owner as Farhad tries to buy a revolver. However, the shop owner refers to him as "Osama bin Laden|Osama", while Farhad tells the shop owner that he is an American citizen. After the shop keeper grows impatient and orders Farhad outside, Dorri defiantly finishes the gun purchase, which she had opposed. 

In another part of town, two black men, Anthony and Peter, carjack Rick Cabot, the local district attorney, and his wife Jean as they are about to enter their Lincoln Navigator. Later, at the Cabot house, Hispanic locksmith Daniel Ruiz is changing their locks when Jean notices his tattoos. She loudly complains about having been carjacked and now having to endure a Hispanic man changing their locks, feeling he will give copies of the keys to "his other gang members". 

Detectives Waters and Ria arrive at the scene of a shooting between two drivers. The surviving shooter is a white male, identified as an undercover police officer. The dead shooter, a black male, is revealed also to be an undercover police officer. There is a large amount of cash found in the black officers trunk. This is the third time the white officer has shot and killed a black man.

LAPD officer John Ryan calls an HMO on behalf of his father and has an argument with a representative named Shaniqua Johnson. He then gets into the squad car with his partner Tom Hansen and sees a car passenger performing fellatio on the driver of a moving vehicle. They pull over the Navigator similar to the one carjacked earlier, despite discrepancies in the descriptions. They order the couple, television director Cameron Thayer and his wife Christine, to exit. Cameron is cooperative, but Christine is argumentative. This annoys Ryan, who manually molests Christine under the pretense of administering a pat-down. Intimidated, Cameron says nothing. The couple is released without a citation. Once home, Christine becomes enraged that Cameron did nothing while she was being violated. Cameron insists that what he did was correct and storms out. 

Arriving home from work long after dark, Daniel finds his young daughter, Lara, hiding under her bed after hearing a gunshot outside. To comfort her, Daniel gives her an "invisible impenetrable cloak", which makes her feel safe enough to fall asleep in her bed. In the carjacked SUV, Anthony and Peter, arguing and distracted, hit a Korean man while passing a parked white van. They argue about what to do with him, finally dumping him in front of a hospital and driving away. Due to the blood in the vehicle, they are unable to receive payment for the carjacking.

The next day, at the Los Angeles Police Department station, Hansen talks to his superior, Lt. Dixon, about switching partners. Dixon, a black man, claims that Hansens charge of Ryan as a racist could cost both Hansen and Dixon their jobs. Dixon suggests a transfer to a one-man car and mockingly tells Hansen that he should justify it by claiming to have uncontrollable flatulence. Ryan visits Shaniqua Johnson and apologizes for the argument. He explains that his father was previously diagnosed with a bladder infection, but he fears it may be prostate cancer. Ryan wants him to see a different doctor, but Shaniqua denies the request. Ryan then proceeds to insult Shaniqua by calling her an affirmative action hire. Shaniqua has him escorted out of her office. 

Daniel is seen replacing a lock at Farhads shop and tries to explain to him that the door frame needs to be replaced. Farhad, whose English is limited, misunderstands and accuses Daniel of cheating him and refuses to pay. The next morning, Farhad discovers the store has been wrecked and defaced with graffiti. His insurance company does not cover the damage, calling it a case of negligence due to the defective door, so he vows revenge on Daniel.

Detective Waters visits his mother, a hard drug abuser. She asks him to find his missing younger brother. He promises and takes notice that there is almost no food in the apartment as he is leaving. When he tries to present evidence in the shooting between undercover police officers, his superiors tell him not to reveal the cash in the black officers trunk, saying that their work in crafting a non-racist image for the department will be undone. Jean comes home and sees dishes in the dishwasher. She accosts her Hispanic maid Maria for not putting them in the cupboards.

Ryan comes across a car accident and as he crawls into the overturned vehicle, he finds Christine trapped. Upon recognizing Ryan, Christine becomes hysterical, but gasoline is leaking from the tank and running downhill towards another wreck, which has already caught fire. He calms her down, and with the assistance of his partner and spectators, Ryan pulls Christine out just as her car bursts into flames. 

Anthony and Peter approach another Navigator which happens to be Camerons. They only see Cameron driving after they open the door and are shocked to see that the driver is black. Cameron is tired of being pushed around and resists. Anthony tells Peter to shoot Cameron, but Peter does not. As police officers arrive, Cameron and Anthony both race for the car and jump in. Cameron drives away, with Anthony continuing to point a gun at him. A car chase ensues. Tom Hansen is one of the police officers who has responded and recognizes Camerons vehicle. Cameron drives into a dead end, puts Anthonys gun into his pocket, and gets out of the car, all the while yelling insults at the officers. Just before he pulls out the gun, Hansen convinces him to stop aggravating the situation and to go home. Hansen vouches for Cameron, fending off the other officers, and promising to give him a "harsh" warning. Later, Cameron tells Anthony that as a black man he is embarrassed for him and drops Anthony off at a bus stop. 

Farhad locates Daniels house and waits in ambush. Just as Daniels wife Elizabeth runs out the front door, she watches in horror while Farhad shoots at Daniel. Daniels daughter Lara jumps into his arms, attempting to protect him with the "invisible cloak". It takes the grief-stricken parents and Farhad a moment to realize that Lara is miraculously unharmed. The box of ammunition that Dorri had selected contained Blank (cartridge)|blanks. Farhad later tells his daughter that he believes that the little girl was his guardian angel, preventing him from committing a terrible crime. 

Jean is complaining to someone she knows over the phone that she wakes up angry every day and does not know why. Immediately afterwards, she slips and falls down a flight of stairs. Later, she phones Rick, telling him of her accident. It turns out that she is alright thanks to Maria.

Peter, who is hitchhiking, is picked up by Hansen. Peter sees that Hansen has a small statuette of Saint Christopher like his own. He begins to laugh as he realizes that they have so much in common, but Hansen thinks that he is being laughed at. Hansen pulls over and tells Peter to get out if he wants to be "funny". Peter moves to pull the statuette out of his pocket in explanation, but Hansen believes he is pulling out a gun and shoots and kills Peter in self-defense. Hansen dumps the body in the bush beside a road and then torches his own car. Peter is revealed to be Waters missing brother. Waters and his mother meet up at the morgue, and Waters promises to find who is responsible. Mrs. Waters blames her surviving son for his brothers death, claiming he was always too busy to look for Peter. 

Anthony returns to the white van owned by the Korean man whom they had run over earlier. Finding the keys still hanging from the door lock, he drives the van away. The Korean mans wife Kim Lee arrives at the previously-mentioned hospital looking for her husband, the man who has been run over, named Choi Jin Gui. Conscious and coherent, he tells her to go and immediately cash a check that he has in his wallet. Anthony has driven the white van to a chop shop he frequents, and as they inspect the van, a number of Cambodian immigrants are discovered locked in the back of the van, revealing that Choi was involved in human trafficking. Anthony is offered $500 for each person in the van. Anthony refuses out of disgust. Anthony drives to Chinatown, Los Angeles|Chinatown, and sets the Cambodian people free. As Anthony drives away, he passes a car crash, which turns out to involve Shaniqua. Shaniqua and the other driver get out and begin to exchange racial slurs as the credits begin to roll.

==Release==

===Box office=== Best Picture since The Last Emperor in 1987. 

===Critical response===
The film received mostly positive reviews. Review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reports that 170 out of the 227 reviews they tallied were positive, for a score of 75% positive reviews and a certification of "fresh", with an average score of 7.3 out of 10,  and the critical consensus "A raw and unsettling morality piece on modern angst and urban disconnect, Crash examines the dangers of bigotry and xenophobia in the lives of interconnected Angelenos", while Metacritic tallied an average score of 69 out of 100 for Crash  critical consensus.  Roger Ebert gave the film four-out-of-four stars and described it as "a movie of intense fascination",  listing it as the best film of 2005. The film also ranks at #460 in Empire (film magazine)|Empire s 2008 poll of the "500 Greatest Films of All Time". 

From an alternate perspective, the film has been critiqued for "laying bare the racialized fantasy of the American dream and Hollywood narrative aesthetics", and for depicting the Persian shopkeeper as a "deranged, paranoid individual who is only redeemed by what he believes is a mystical act of God".  The film has also been criticized for using multicultural and sentimental imagery to cover over material and "historically sedimented inequalities" that continue to affect different racial groups in Los Angeles. 

===Oscar controversy===  Best Picture Oscar at the 78th Academy Awards, controversially beating the critically favored Brokeback Mountain and making it only the second film ever (the other being The Sting) to win the Academy Award for Best Picture without having been nominated for any of the three Golden Globe Awards for Best Motion Picture (Best Drama, Best Comedy/Musical and Best Foreign Film).

The films use of moral quandary as a storytelling medium was widely reported as ironic, since many saw it as the "safe" choice to Brokeback Mountain. Critic Kenneth Turan suggested that Crash benefited from anti-homosexual discomfort among Academy members,   while critic Roger Ebert was of a different opinion, arguing that the better film won that year. He went on to question why many critics were not mentioning the other nominees and that they were just mindlessly bashing Crash merely because it won over Brokeback Mountain. Ebert also placed Crash on his best ten list as #1 best film of 2005,  and correctly predicted it to win Best Picture. 

Film Comment magazine placed Crash first on their list of "Worst Winners of Best Picture Oscars", followed by Slumdog Millionaire at #2, and Chicago (2002 film)|Chicago at #3. 

===Accolades=== Best Picture. Best Supporting Best Screenplay (Paul Haggis and Robert Moresco).
