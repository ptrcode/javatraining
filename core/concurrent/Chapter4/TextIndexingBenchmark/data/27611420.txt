 Yugoslav film directed by Žika Mitrović. It is one of the most notable examples of partisan film, a Yugoslav subgenre of World War II films which was popular between the 1960s and 1980s. The prevailing themes of anti-fascist struggle set in wartime Yugoslavia are also present here, as the film tells the story of the rise and fall of the Republic of Užice, a short-lived territory liberated by Yugoslav partisans which existed for several months in 1941.
 Chetnik leader Marko Todorović as Josip Broz Tito.   
 Best Film and Best Supporting Actress (Ružica Sokić).    It was also entered into the 9th Moscow International Film Festival where it won a Diploma.
