 Sylvester the Tom Holland as the voice of Slowpoke Rodriguez.

The cartoon has Sylvester trying to catch Speedy in a house they share in Mexico. Sylvester switches targets when Slowpoke Rodriguez, Speedys cousin, comes to visit. This is the second and final classic Looney Tunes short (after Mexicali Shmoes) to feature Slowpoke Rodriguez.

==Plot== Sylvester the Cat (dubbed "Sylvero Gato" here) is "the most pooped cat in all Mexico" from his futile attempts to catch Speedy. The cat eats pep pills to get the energy needed to catch the mouse, to no effect. Their pursuit is interrupted when Speedys country cousin, Slowpoke Rodriguez, knocks on the door.
 bindle stick and singing "La Cucaracha". The cat, seeing easier prey, lets Slowpoke into the hacienda where he is quickly rescued by Speedy. Complaining of hunger, Slowpoke sets out for the kitchen to get food only to be rescued again by Speedy. Speedy successfully raids the kitchen for cheese but Slowpoke complains that his cousin forgot the Tabasco sauce. During this second raid, the cat paints the floor with glue and actually catches Speedy but winds up swallowing the hot sauce, not the mouse, and Speedy escapes.

After a very large meal, Slowpoke announces that hes ready for dessert. An incredulous Speedy makes another raid on the pantry where the cat has put up a wire mesh to stop the mice. Speedy runs right through the large holes with Sylvero right behind, stretching the mesh but passing through apparently unharmed. As the chase continues, the cat falls to pieces one cube at a time.
 mesmerizes the cat, making him an unwilling servant to bring them food and cool them with a fan.

==Edited versions==
On his arrival, Slowpoke sings the traditional first verse of "La Cucaracha". ("La cucaracha, la cucaracha, Ya no puede caminar, Porque no tiene, porque le falta, Marijuana que fumar." This translates as "The cockroach, the cockroach, Now he cant go traveling, Because he doesnt have, because he lacks, Marijuana to smoke.")  Mexican Boarders was one of several "Speedy Gonzales" shorts edited by Cartoon Network to avoid offending modern sensibilities then dropped from its lineup, along with the other Looney Tunes/Merrie Melodies cartoons, for several years. 

On Nickelodeon, this cartoon was edited to remove the scene where Sylvester opens a bottle of pep pills and chugs them down. Early appearances of the cartoon on Looney Tunes on Nickelodeon cut out the entire scene (having the narrators line appear over a blacked-out screen) while later appearances replaced the shot of Sylvester downing pills with a freeze-framed shot of Sylvester lying exhausted on the ground. 

==Other media==
