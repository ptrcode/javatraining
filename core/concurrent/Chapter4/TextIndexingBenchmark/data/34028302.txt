 Yahi tribe. Some think it is superior to the 1992 version of the same story The Last of His Tribe, also a TV movie starring Jon Voight which was criticized for being too politically correct.   

Eloy Casados played the title role, telecast on NBC December 20, 1978. The film was written by Christopher Trumbo (who shared the writing credits with his father Dalton Trumbo who had died earlier),    and directed by Robert Ellis Miller.
