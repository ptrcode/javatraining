 1940 film Robert Young, Kenneth Roberts titled Northwest Passage (novel)|Northwest Passage (1937).
 American Indian tribe.  The purpose of the raid is to avenge the many attacks on British settlers and deter further attacks.
 Rogers and his men are about to go on a search for the Northwest Passage.

==Plot== Robert Young) Sir William Johnson, unaware that Clagett is sitting in the next room with another official. Facing arrest for his comments, Langdon fights the two men with the help of "Hunk" Marriner (Walter Brennan), a local woodsman and friend, before they both escape into the woods.
 American Indian. Major Rogers (Spencer Tracy), the commander of Rogers Rangers. Needing Langdons mapmaking skills, Rogers recruits the two men for his latest expedition, one to destroy the hostile Abenakis tribe and their town of Saint-Fran√ßois-du-Lac, Quebec|St. Francis far to the north.
 French forces Mohawk scouts who were dismissed by Rogers. During the confrontation, a powder keg explodes which injures some of his force. However, Rogers not only sends back the injured to Crown Point, but the disloyal Mohawks provided him by Sir William Johnson (Frederick Worlock), and a number of his men who didnt obey orders to avoid a confrontation with the Mohawks. Although his force is depleted, the rangers move onto their objective.  Concealing their boats for a much later return, the force marches northward through swampland, avoiding dry land wherever possible to conceal their movements. When informed by his Stockbridge Indian scouts left to watch over the boats that the French have captured their boats and extra supplies, Rogers revises his plan and sends an injured officer back to Fort Crown Point requesting the British to send supplies to old Fort Wentworth, where the returning rangers will meet them.

After making a human chain to cross an unbridged river, the rangers reach St. Francis. The force succeeds in their attack, setting fire to the dwellings and cutting the Abenakis off from retreat. When the battle is over, however, the rangers find only a few baskets of parched corn with which to replenish their dwindling provisions. Worse, as Marriner is searching the destroyed village, he comes across a prostrate Langdon suffering from a bullet wound in his abdomen. Facing hostile forces and a long march with only meager supplies, the rangers set out on their course to Wentworth, trying to evade the French and Indians pursuing them. Their initial objective is Lake Memphremagog, with the injured Langdon bringing up the rear.
 game to eat. Game proves scare, though; worse, two of the detachments are ambushed by the French and most of the men killed.

After persevering through harsh conditions, Rogers and the remaining fifty men finally reach the fort, only to find it unoccupied and in a state of disrepair. The hoped-for British relief column has not arrived. Though personally despairing, Rogers attempts to rally the men, who are on the verge of collapse. As Rogers attempts to perk up their flagging spirits with a prayer, they hear the  . Rogers fires them up with a brief speech telling them of all the wonders they will see while they march towards the first point of embarkation, a little fort called "Detroit." He passes by Langdon and Elizabeth to say goodbye where Elizabeth informs him that she and Langdon are headed for London where she is hopeful he will learn to become a great painter. Rogers bids them farewell and marches down the road and off into the sunset.

==Production==
The movie was filmed in central Idaho, near Payette Lake and the city of McCall, Idaho|McCall.

The movie wound up as MGMs most expensive film since Ben Hur (1926).  The picture was originally slated for an even more lavish budget in an earlier incarnation and was to star Wallace Beery and Tracy but management difficulties between Irving Thalberg and Louis B. Mayer interceded at that time.

==Depiction of American Indians== American Indians Hollywood at the time. This treatment, however, mirrors the section of the book set during the French and Indian War, which was highly regarded for its historical research and accuracy. 

==Box office==
According to MGM records the film earned $2,169,000 in the US and Canada and $981,000 elsewhere but because of its high cost incurred a loss of $885,000. 

==Awards and honors== The Thief of Bagdad.

==Sequels and related projects== Kenneth Roberts served as a co-writer on a second draft of a proposed script for the movie, one that covered the entire novel, not just the first book of it.  However, executives at MGM scuttled the revision and instead used the first draft of the script, which covered only the first book, as the basis for the finished film.  This is why the film Northwest Passage was subtitled Book One: Rogers Rangers.

Director King Vidor then attempted to make a sequel to the film in which Rogers Rangers find the Northwest Passage, although Roberts refused to cooperate with the project. But filming never began, because MGM ultimately refused to "Green-light|greenlight" it.
 Northwest Passage starring Keith Larsen as Robert Rogers, with Buddy Ebsen costarring as "Hunk" Marriner, replacing Walter Brennan, who had his own TV series, The Real McCoys, in production at the time. The show aired on NBC.
