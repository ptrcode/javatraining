==Critical reception==
*TV Guide wrote, "its all chase and melodrama with little care for characterizations."   Northwest Frontier romp, with Victor Mature in dark make-up as Kasim Khan...romantic interest from forgotten starlet Anne Aubrey and some wince-inducing comic mugging from Anthony Newley. Quite a lot of money was thrown at it, but this remains a B-movie at heart."  
*Sky Movies called the film "a fiery 19th century adventure yarn that makes little sense but bulges with action that keeps coming at you."
