==Plot==
In England during WWII, Alice, a woman running a farm in the countryside, discovers a man named Barton roaming the fields. He helps around the farm and the two become friends, then lovers. Barton decides to desert the army. Alice offers him refuge in exchange for help running the farm in her husbands absence, who has been taken prisoner by the Japanese. Barton puts Alices ailing dog out of its misery by shooting it with her husbands shotgun.   When army MPs begin to search for Barton he must prevent himself from being caught, so Alice helps him form the disguise of a woman, Jill, her "sister."  A Sergeant soon begins to take a liking to Jill.  As Christmas approaches, the Sergeant returns to invite Alice and Jill to a Christmas party. Alice declines, but Barton, wanting to get out and have some fun, accepts the offer much to Alices disapproval.  During the party, the Sergeant and another soldier take Jill and a woman into a back room to engage in some sexual activity, but when Jill pushes the Sergeant away he discovers the secret.  Barton escapes and the MPs follow, hunt him down near the farm house where Alice is waiting.  With Alice not wanting Barton to suffer at the hands of the soldiers, she shoots him dead with her husbands shotgun.
