==Plot==
It is the 1970s; Fritz the Cat is now married, on welfare, and has a child named Ralphie, who casually masturbation|masturbates. As his wife screams at him for being an irresponsible father and husband, Fritz sits on the couch, staring off into space, smoking a marijuana|joint. Tired of listening to his wife nag at him, he fades off into his own little world, imagining what life would be like for him if things were different. 
 Puerto Rican. The two talk about Juans sister Chita. The scene fades to Juans house where Fritz is seen sitting on the couch smoking a joint next to Chita, while Juan is at the store. Chita complains to Fritz when he blows smoke in her eyes. His reaction is to tell her to loosen up and "embrace her fellow man", then he suddenly shoves a joint into her mouth, taking her off into her own hallucinogenic fantasy. The pot makes her horny. Meanwhile, outside, a pair of crows are about to rob the place, but decide to stay outside and watch what happens inside instead. A car pulls up and out comes Chitas father, who sees Fritz and Chita having sex, and blows Fritz apart with a shotgun. This violent display turns off the two crows, who decide to come back at another time. 
 Nazi Germany. US United States Army|Army. 
 the clap. When Niki asks who her name is, Fritz responds by telling him "Gina". Niki says that thats his wifes name and that she doesnt have the clap. Fritz tells him "she does now," causing Niki to curse and shout at Fritz. As he walks out of the store, Fritz bumps into a pig named Lenny. Fritz tells him that he was an irresistible stud in the 1930s. Fritzs fifth life is a psychedelic montage of old stock film and animation, vaguely illustrating Fritzs downfall in the 1930s (losing everything to excessive partying and drinking). 
 black girl. However, the space shuttle takes off a little early, and, once in space, it explodes.
 President Henry Kissinger to deliver a letter to the president of New Africa. In New Africa, Fritz finds a high crime rate, Political corruption|corruption, and violence. Once Fritz is led to "The Black House", he hears the president of New Africa and his vice-president talking about how low his popularity is, and how an assassination attempt would boost his popularity. The president refuses to get shot, but is shot anyway, because the vice president needs his presidents popularity to increase so he will not lose the upcoming election. The vice-president blames the assassination on Fritz, because he is the only "white (people)|white" cat in New Africa. Because of this, America and "New Africa" are at war, and Kissinger eventually admits an unconditional surrender. In the end, Fritz is shot for the crime he did not commit.

In his final life, Fritz finds himself living in the sewers of New York, where he meets an Indian guru, and the devil. However, Fritz is given a rude awakening from his drug-induced reality by his wife, who finally throws him out of the apartment. After a quick look at all of his lives, Fritz sighs and says "This is about the worst life Ive ever had."

==Production==

The films title has been seen as ironic, as the characters creator, Robert Crumb, had previously drawn a story in which the character was killed. 

Although filmmaker Ralph Bakshi had written and directed the films 1972 predecessor, he chose not to direct The Nine Lives of Fritz the Cat in favor of Heavy Traffic, and had absolutely no involvement with the film. However, Bakshi has sometimes been incorrectly credited as having worked on the film, such as in Jeff Lenburgs Whos Who in Animated Cartoons, which claims that Bakshi had been a producer on the film.  Directorial duties were instead given to Robert Taylor, an animator who had worked on The Mighty Heroes, a superhero spoof Bakshi created in the 1960s. Stylistically, Taylor attempted to recreate only some of the elements and themes of the original film. The setting of the films period is similar to that of the first film, with the speaker addressing the audience with "jump back, baby." However, unlike the first film, The Nine Lives of Fritz the Cat was made during the era it was set in. Because the filmmakers only had three years of history to work with, much of the film diverges into various storytelling directions, including sections focusing on the 1930s, Nazi Germany, and an alternate future. The films ending credits play over animation of Fritz dancing down the street in tune with Tom Scotts music.

Taylor cowrote the films screenplay with Fred Halliday and Eric Monte. Steve Krantz would later produce Montes screenplay Cooley High, which was developed into the television sitcom Whats Happening!!
 Tom Scott 45 Revolutions RPM single featuring two songs from the film, "Jump Back," and "TCB in E" was released in 1974. 

==Awards==
Award nominations:
* Golden Palm - Robert Taylor

==Reception== Time Out described the film as being "woefully inept,"  while Ralph Bakshi later contrasted Taylors efforts to how his film might have turned out if prospective distributor Warner Bros. had been allowed to tone down the content of the film,    and states that Robert Crumb does not acknowledge The Nine Lives of Fritz the Cat because "He would have to say, Well, Ralph did do a better picture than Nine Lives. So to Robert Crumb, there is no Nine Lives. It doesnâ€™t exist." 
 UK as part of a DVD box set entitled The Fritz the Cat Collection.
