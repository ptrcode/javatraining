This movie is about the destructive method of Muro-Ami in the Philippines and its effect on the poor. It is a look at the poverty in the Visayas , primarily seen through the eyes of the coral fishers (Muro-Ami).

== Plot ==
Fredo (Cesar Montano) is a fisherman who has endured more than his share of hardship in life; his wife and child both perished in a boating accident, and today Fredo approaches each trip to the sea with the angry determination of a man out for revenge. Fredo commands a crew of young people from poor families as he takes his rattletrap ship into the ocean in search of fish that live along the reefs, snaring catch with an illegal netting system. Not all of Fredos youthful sailors are willing to put up with his abusive arrogance, however, and even his father Dado (Pen Medina) and close friend Botong (Jhong Hilario) have grown weary of Fredos tirades. Fredos body is beginning to betray him as well, and as he and his crew damage the seas reef beds in search of fish, no one is certain how much longer he will be able to continue.

Maestro Fredo, a tyrant captain, fixates to claim the treasures of the seaâ€”no matter what, in whatever diabolical technique for as long as he profits. He employs dozens of men, mostly children, in his dangerous expeditions. Conditions aboard the ships are oppressive. Children are often overworked and his crew is furious with the way they are living. He blames the sea for claiming the lives of his family and he exacts revenge by plundering its depths.
