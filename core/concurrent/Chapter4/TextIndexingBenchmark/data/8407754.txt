Mad as a Mars Hare is a 1963 Warner Bros. Merrie Melodies cartoon featuring Bugs Bunny and Marvin the Martian. The cartoons title is a play-on-words of the famous phrase to be "mad as a March hare", the origins of which are disputed.

==Plot==
This cartoon begins with Marvin the Martian observing the planet Earth from Mars through a telescope. He is examining a rocket launch that is taking place. As he watches, the rocket takes off from Earth and soon appears to be heading straight towards him. Indeed, the rocket ploughs right through his observatory and once a shaken Marvin gets himself up, he says to the audience "Im not angry, just terribly, terribly hurt!" Soon enough, the rocket lands on Mars, and a reluctant Bugs Bunny exits it. It is quickly apparent that he is the only occupant and he has been lured onto the rocket by a carrot and then sent to Mars as what Earth considered an expendable “astro-rabbit.”

Bugs immediately claims Mars as his own (using a metal  ). Bugs then breaks the fourth Wall while speaking to the audience about how when he gets back to Earth old Elmer Fudd and the rest of the hunters are due for a big surprise before eating the metal carrot.

==Availability==
"Mad as a Mars Hare" is available on the Bugs Bunny: Hare Extraordinare DVD. However, it was cropped to widescreen. It is also being shown fully screened on the   Blu-ray box-set. And it soon be available on the DVD version of the Looney Tunes Platinum Collection.
