Forty years after the events of Goin Down the Road Joey has died in Vancouver and Pete — who left Toronto with Joey after a violent incident — must return to the city to honour Joeys request that his ashes be taken back to Cape Breton Island.  Betty-Jo, Joey and Bettys daughter, joins him in the journey, driving cross-Canada in the same Chevrolet Impala#Second generation (1959–1960)|1959/60 Chevy Impala convertible that Joey and Pete used when they left home in 1970.  The return to Cape Breton becomes Joeys final gift to Pete, as he reconnects with Betty, Selina and Annie, and learns about Matt.

==Production==
According to Jayne Eastwood, Cayle Chernin was a strong advocate convincing director Shebib to make this sequel to his 1970 film.     When Chernin was diagnosed with ovarian cancer in June 2010, she chose to forgo standard cancer treatments to stay active enough to reprise her Selina character.   Filming was completed in October 2010, and Chernin died on 18 February 2011.
