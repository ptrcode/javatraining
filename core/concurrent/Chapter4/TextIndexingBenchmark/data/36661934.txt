==Style==
Derek Elley of Film Business Asia commented that outside the fact that the characters were speaking Mandarin, that the film "looks exactly like a South Korean one — from its clean-looking shooting style, photography, editing, music and even immaculate wardrobe — and with its remote setting could just as well have been shot in South Korea as well."    The Chinese title of the film translates to a type of ouija board game using a pen, but no such item appears in the film. 

==Release==
Bunshinsaba was released in China on July 12, 2012.  The film grossed RMB32.0 million (US$5.01 million) in the first seven days of its theatrical run.  Since the films release, director  Ahn Byeong-ki has become the first South Korean director to set up his own workshop (ByungKi An China Studio) in Mainland China.  The film ended its theatrical run grossing  RMB61 million (US$9.93 million).    The film was followed up with a sequel  Bunshinsaba 2 in 2013 and Bunshinsaba3 in 2014.
