==Reception==
Although an initial commercial success,    the film producers knew that the film was far from accurate; indeed, an introductory title describes the plot as "a poetic interpretation of   youth."  The film has thus been called a "travesty" because it had so many biographical inaccuracies.  The film greatly upset the Caruso family who ended up suing the producers of the film for five million lire.  Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer was also forced to withdraw The Great Caruso from distribution in Italy, despite the film being a major success.

Shortly after the films release Ermanno Randi was murdered by his lover Giuseppe Maggiore in a jealous rage.
