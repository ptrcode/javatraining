==Plot==
On a subway train, a white woman takes a seat beside a black man and begins a conversation. She is aggressive and tries to be seductive. When the man flatly rejects her advances, the woman becomes loud and rude, insulting him and his race. The man, polite up to this point, begins responding in kind.

When he finally can take no more of her verbal abuse, the man strikes the woman, whereupon she pulls out a knife and stabs him. During the chaos that ensues, the woman slips away, boards another train car and appears to search for another man.
