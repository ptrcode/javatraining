One day, while playing one of her pranks, an old man curses her. On top of that, she witnesses a pregnant woman falling at night and suffering immense pain before ultimately dying. This incident causes Chittis fear of pregnancy. However, the young man Mohan Babu visits the village and befriends Chitti. Soon after that, her parents arrange the marriage between Chitti and Mohan Babu. Both are more than happy with this arrangement. After the wedding, however, Chitti doesnt want to consummate the marriage out of fear of pregnancy. Mohan Babu is unhappy about it and soon gets attracted to a young doctor (Pooja Bedi). Dreaming of spending nights with her, Mohan Babu gets drunk and soon after goes home and rapes Chittui. The next morning, upon getting sober, Mohan Babu tries to comfort the outraged Chitti while the latter tries to leave for her home village to go back to her parents. Mohan Babu tries to win her back but fails time after time. Soon Chitti has to realise that she got pregnant that night while her doctor turns out to be the woman her husband got crazy for.
