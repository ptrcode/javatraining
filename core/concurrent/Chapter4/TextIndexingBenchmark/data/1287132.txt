He tears up his Warner Bros. cartoon contract and walks off the set to devote his life to fishing, stunning Bugs, who piteously protests and effortlessly tries to ask him to reconsider. During a relaxing fishing trip, Elmer falls asleep.
 dreamland plight, surreal landscape.

 
Elmers anger at a failed pursuit through the surreal landscape, down connected rabbit holes, is promptly used against him by Bugs who inquires "Whats the matter doc, ya cold? Here, Ill fix dat". Before Elmer can protest, Bugs dresses him like a woman by wrapping his body with green material from the right, slapping a wig on him, and applying lipstick. Bugs inspects his handiwork, then lifts the backdrop to reveal a trio of literal wolves, lounging by the sign at Hollywood and Vine. When the trio notice Elmer, one wolf hollers "Hooooow old is she?!", right before another wolf begins flirting with Elmer. Bugs enjoys watching the male wolves hit on Elmer, making the hunter now the hunted in a new way. Elmer grabs the hem of his gown and flees from the wolves, who give chase, briefly stopping to ask the audience "Have any of you giwls evew had an expewience wike this?".

==Edited versions==
*Network syndication versions (and some versions of the cartoon that aired on the Ted Turner-owned superstations TBS and TNT) edit the scene of Bugs Bunny using sleeping pills (from a bottle labeled, "Sleeping Pills: Take Deze and Doze") to get into Elmers dream, making it seem as if Bugs fell asleep on his own (albeit with a fake black-out or dissolve to the next scene).
*Cartoon Network had this cartoon edited the same way as syndication, TBS, and TNT used to air it, until the cartoon short aired on The Bob Clampett Show (which became known for airing cartoons by Bob Clampett that either would be shown edited or not shown at all), where the sleeping pill scene was left intact. As of 2011, this short is being shown uncut on Cartoon Network (although it doesnt have the opening sequence and the "Dubbed Version  © 1995 Turner Entertainment Co." end card is not used).

==Availability==
The Big Snooze is available in a restored, uncensored version on the   DVD set, and as part of the compilation Whats Up, Doc? A Salute to Bugs Bunny on  .
