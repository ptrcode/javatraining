==Plot==
Krakozhian traveler Viktor Navorski (Tom Hanks) arrives at New Yorks  John F. Kennedy International Airport, only to find that his passport is suddenly no longer valid due to the outbreak of a civil war in Krakozhia, his homeland. As a result, the United States no longer recognizes Krakozhia as a sovereign nation, and he is not permitted to either enter the country or return home as he is now Statelessness|stateless. Due to his inability to communicate in proper English, US Customs and Border Protection seizes his passport and airline ticket.
 US Customs under the table after he impulsively remodeled a wall at a gate that was scheduled for future renovation.
 A Great Hungarian newspaper tenor saxophonist Benny Golson. Viktor has come to New York to do so. After hearing the story, Amelia kisses Viktor.

After nine months, his friends wake Viktor with the news that the war in Krakozhia has ended. Amelia also asked her "friend"—actually a married government official with whom she had been having an affair—to get Viktor a one-day emergency visa to fulfill his dream, but Viktor is disappointed to learn she has renewed her relationship with the man during this process. Moreover, Viktor finds out that Dixon must sign the visa. Seizing the opportunity, Dixon threatens to cause trouble for Viktors friends, most seriously by deporting Gupta back to India, where he is wanted for assaulting a corrupt police officer back in 1979. Unwilling to let this happen, Viktor finally agrees to go home to Krakozhia. When Gupta learns of this, however, he runs in front of the plane to Krakozhia as it taxies to the terminal, resulting in his deportation, effectively taking the burden off Viktor.

The delay gives Viktor enough time to go into the city. Dixon, watching Viktor leave the airport, decides not to pursue him. Viktor arrives in New York at the hotel where Benny Golson is performing and finally collects the last autograph. Then he gets in a taxi, telling the driver, "I am going home."
