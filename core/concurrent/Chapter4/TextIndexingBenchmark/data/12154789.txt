==Production==
We Dive at Dawn was filmed at Gaumont-British Studios in London,  with the co-operation of the British Admiralty. John Mills prepared for his role as the captain of Sea Tiger by riding on a submarine on a training mission down the River Clyde|Clyde. He recalled a crash dive:  The ship then seemed to stand on her nose and I felt her speeding like an arrow towards the sea bed; charts and crockery went flying in all directions; I hung on to a rail near the periscope trying to look heroic and totally unconcerned; the only thing that concerned me was the fact that I was sure that my face had turned a pale shade of pea-green.
