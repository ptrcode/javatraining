}} novel of the same name by Dean Koontz, and stars Jeff Goldblum, Alicia Silverstone, Christine Lahti, and Jeremy Sisto. In the film, Goldblum plays a man who dies in a car accident, only to be revived two hours later. After being revived, he experiences frightening visions. He begins to understand that he has become psychically connected to a serial killer, and that by cutting himself, he can actually induce the visions and see through the killers eyes. Unfortunately, the vision works both ways, and the killer can also see through his eyes. Birmingham band Godflesh make a cameo appearance during one of the films scenes.

==Plot==
After killing his mother and sister and ritualistically arranging their bodies as a sacrifice to Satan, Devil worshipper "Vassago" (Sisto) invokes a Satanic verse in a room filled with candles and Satanic imagery. He then commits suicide by throwing himself onto an athame in order to damn his soul.

Hatch Harrison (Goldblum) is on a drive with his family. Harrison gets into a car accident and is pronounced dead, only to be revived two hours later by specialist Dr. Jonas Nyebern (Molina). His wife Lindsay (Lahti), and daughter Regina (Silverstone), were also involved in the car accident but escaped without serious injuries.

After the accident and subsequent revival, Harrison begins to experience mysterious visions. These involve him seeing murders through the eyes of a killer. Harrison realizes that the murders are actually happening when the women he sees being murdered are announced as missing in news reports. The character Harrison sees committing the murders is later shown to be the same character who committed suicide in the opening sequence. The character, who is identified as Vassago, talks to Harrisons daughter at a night club, which Harrison sees in his visions.

Harrison attempts to stop Vassago from murdering only to be told that he is experiencing mental problems by his family, his psychiatrist, and the police. Harrison visits a psychic (Chong) who confirms his beliefs and tells him that Vassago is also having visions in which he can see through Harrisons eyes. It is then revealed that Vassago, whose real name is Jeremy Nyebern, is the son of Dr. Nyebern and who had killed his mother and sister. After his suicide (shown in the opening sequence), he had also been revived from the dead by his father.

Vassago then kidnaps Regina, taking her to an abandoned amusement park where he kills his father after being confronted by him. As Harrison and his wife find them, the souls of Vassago and Harrison collide in battle. Harrison, revealing himself to Vassago as "Uriel," Vassagos antithesis, is the victor, killing Vassago, saving Regina, and with his family safe, exits the park with his family.

The final scene after the credits shows Hatch dreaming about Vassago being pulled in to be revived again. The operation becomes a success but only before Vassago wakes up, takes a scalpel, and slits a nurses throat. He wakes up, seeing he was only dreaming. He then hugs Lindsay and falls back to sleep.
