 Indian Bollywood film directed by Rahul Dholakia and stars Jimmy Shergill, Kim Sharma, Paresh Rawal in pivotal roles.

==Plot==

Ranchhod Rai Patel (Paresh Rawal) is an egotistical and arrogant self-made Gujarati man who arrived from India and settled in the New York area years ago. He started his career cleaning latrines and dirty clothes, then moved on to working in a restaurant, saving enough money to own one, and then finally owned twelve. He became an extremely successful real-estate magnate, Ã  la Donald Trump and was so big-headed that started calling himself THE Roger Patel. He got married to a woman named Kamla and they were soon proud parents of two lovely daughters, Namrata and Ritu. When the girls are grown, the overprotective Roger arranges a marriage for Namrata with a property owner, a professional Patel man named Prem. Ritu Patel (Kim Sharma), a doctor, informs that she has met her soul mate also, Sunder Kapoor (Jimmy Shergill), who is part-Punjabi and part-Madrasi and is definitely not a Patel, nor a property owner, and not even a professional
