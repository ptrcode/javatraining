Through the handsome miner Alejo, Belén learns about the legend of the Blue Diamonds surrounding that region. Nearby the kindly town, she discovers the Rincón de Niños Huerfanos, a horrendous place where a group of oppressed young orphans is forced into heavy labor. Their masters are the Colonel Estévez and the janitor Marga. The lives of the young prisoners are touched and changed after Belén starts working at the manor, as she relieves their pain, filing their lives with love and songs.
