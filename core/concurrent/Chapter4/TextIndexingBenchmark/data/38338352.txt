==Plot==
In a Gujarati village, Ranjaar, infamous for its uninhibited manufacture and sale of arms and ammunition (weapons are sold like vegetables at the place), two clans, Rajadi and Sanera, have been at odds with each other for the past 500 years. The film opens with a violent altercation between the two over petty matters. Meghji (Abhimanyu Singh), a Rajadi head, sets out to kill Bhavani (Gulshan Devaiah) who is a Sanera, after the latter tries to kill the formers son. Bhavani is almost killed but Ram (Ranveer Singh), Meghjis younger brother, intervenes and saves him, only to be reprimanded by Meghji. All the Rajadi elders are irked by Rams mindset of making truce with the other clan.
 Supriya Pathak Kapur), the chieftain of the Saneras, is busy arranging a match for her daughter with a simple-minded Non-resident Indian|NRI.

Kanji (Sharad Kelkar), Leelas elder brother, angered by Rams entry in the house, bribes the local police to raid the house of Rajadi heads, but Ram manages to convince the policemen to leave in exchange for a set of his blue films. Ram and Leela get romantically involved and plan to elope but a grim turn of events follows when Kanji accidentally kills Meghji, and is in turn killed by Ram.

To escape the suffering, Ram and Leela elope and marry but Rams friends trace them and trick Ram by making him drunk and knock him out of his senses. They send an SMS informing the Saneras of their location from Rams phone. The next morning, Leela is forcibly taken back home by Bhavani, her cousin, while Ram is hailed as a hero by the Rajadis for soiling the reputation of Leela, and her chieftain. He is rewarded by being made the new chieftain of the Rajadi.

Leela still retains faith in Ram and sends Rasila (Richa Chadda), widow of Kanji, to give Ram an ultimatum to take her away. Rasila, however is molested by Rams friends and when Dhankor Baa learns of this, she sends Bhavani and other men to assault Kesar (Barkha Bisht Sengupta), Meghjis widow, who manages to evade them.

In response to the attempt on Kesar, Ram storms into Leelas house and incapacitates the guards single-handedly. He then requests Dhankor Baa to consider negotiation for peace, following which she invites him for a function at home with the intention to kill Ram. However, at the event, Bhavani secretly shoots and seriously injures Dhankor Baa but the Rajadis are blamed.

Leela is made the chieftain and gets busy tending to her mother. Ram and Leela bitterly carry out a negotiation with the sarpanch but Bhavani manipulates things and makes Leela blindly sign a document ordering the killings of Rajadis.

During Dusshera, as the Ramlila parade is ending, many Rajadis are killed and the village is on the brink of war, which Ram senses. Ram and Leela believe they are the sole owners of each others lives, and hence they decide to kill each other instead of dying fighting. Leela agrees and both commit suicide, not knowing that Dhankor Baa has undergone a change of heart and has killed Bhavani, ordering peace be meted out to the other clan. The two clans finally unite to cremate the bodies of Ram and Leela together respectfully.

==Development and production==

===Budget===
The budget of the film has been estimated to be between    and  . 

===Casting===
Ranveer Singh was signed on for the role of Ram. Bhansali then cast Kareena Kapoor for the role of Leela. However, she walked out of the film and instead did Dharma Productions romantic comedy Gori Tere Pyaar Mein.  There were then rumours that Bhansali had approached Priyanka Chopra for the role of Leela.  However, Ranveer Singh confirmed in August 2012 that Deepika Padukone was finally signed on for the film.     Singh, who plays a Gujarati boy, had to learn some Gujarati abuses as well as gain muscle for his character in the film.  The first look of the film shows Padukone sporting a 30&nbsp;kg ghaghra with a 50&nbsp;metre ghera. 

Richa Chadda was also signed on to play a significant role, cast by Shruti Mahajan  whereas Barkha Bisht plays a supporting role opposite Abhimanyu Singh.  Designer Sabyasachi Mukherjee, who previously worked with Bhansali on Black (2005 film)|Black, was hired initially for the costumes of the leading lady, but was later replaced by Anju Modi.  Maxima Basu is the costume designer for Ranveer Singh and rest of the principal cast.

There were rumours that Madhuri Dixit would be performing an item number for the film.  Other actresses were also speculated to be signed for the song including Aishwarya Rai Bachchan (Bhansalis heroine from Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam, Devdas (2002 Hindi film)|Devdas, and Guzaarish) and Priyanka Chopra.  Chopra was eventually confirmed to be performing the song. 

===Production=== Udaipur palace and Gangaur Ghat where a song sequence was shot.   The story of the film is set in Gujarat.  In Udaipur, Singh shot a song sequence in freezing cold water for about 45&nbsp;minutes.    Padukone was injured on set; however she had to continue shooting as an expensive set was put up at Film City for the song "Nagada Sang Dhol."  Sanjay Leela Bhansali had set up a gym on the sets in Filmcity Mumbai for the lead actor Ranveer Singh to not be late for the shooting and to avoid any delays for the movie. 

Some religious groups opposed the movie claiming that the former title Ramleela was misleading because the movie had nothing to do with Ramlila, traditional enactment of the life and story of Hindu deity, Lord Rama. A local court in Mumbai has issued an "ex-parte ad-interim stay" over the use of term Ramleela in the movie title.    A Delhi court, on 12 November, stayed the release of the movie as per suit filed by six petitioners, including Prabhu Samaj Dharmik Ram Leela Committee, saying the movie hurt the religious sentiments of Hindus. Later the films title was changed to Goliyon ki Rasleela Ram-Leela. On 21 November 2013, Lucknow bench of Allahabad High Court banned the movie in Uttar Pradesh.  
   

Kshatriya community opposed usage of community names in the movie, so Jadeja and Rabari community titles were changed to Saneda and Rajadi.

Mohar Basu of Koimoi gave the album four out of five stars stating, "Bhansalis artistic finickiness is something that shows even in his music. He is neat with his tunes and creates soulful sounds with visible conviction. Perhaps the songs wont hit you well in the first shot, but with the lapse of a few loops, it will be hard to take off the songs from your playlist. The album is one of the best of this year and it resounds with near perfect mystical rendition. I am going with a 4/5 and recommending that you dont miss this little masterpiece of an album!"   

Daily News and Analysis also gave the album four out of five and wrote, "Packed with 10 culturally nourished songs, the Ram-Leela soundtrack has no remix or reprised version, but its a feast for music lovers. Director Sanjay Leela Bhansali, known for making many a magum-opus, adds grandeur to the album with his compositions but at the same time gives enough space to the singers to shine."   

Yashika Mathur of Business Standard stated, "The strong point of the "Ram-Leela" album is the soft romantic songs. Bhansali has put his best musical foot forward. It deserves to be heard and enjoyed."   

Joginder Tuteja of Rediff.com stated, "With just about everything working for the music of Ram Leela, what with classical, folk, fusion as well as contemporary sound finding their place under the sun, Bhansali makes sure that the soundtrack stands out from the clutter of some below average music of some notable biggies that have been making the rounds."   

==Release==
The film released on 14 November 2013.The film got widest release 2000+ screens in domestic market and 550 screens in overseas and worldwide with around 2550  Screens 

==Critical response==
The film received generally positive reviews from critics. 

===India===
Taran Adarsh of Bollywood Hungama gave the movie 4.5 out of 5 stars and wrote "On the whole, Goliyon Ki Raasleela ought to be watched for multiple reasons: the electrifying chemistry between its lead actors, the strong dramatic content, the scintillating musical score, the violent streak in the narrative and of course, Sanjay Leela Bhansalis execution of the material." 

Meena Iyer of The Times of India gave the movie 4 out of 5 stars, saying "For the most part, Ram-Leela, SLBs most commercial work till date, has nice doses of raunch and ras (juice). Since the plot is Shakespearan, the maker has the arduous task of telling you this story on an opulent scale. Vintage palaces and daunting deserts are fitted in with precision. Deepika is breathtaking and in top form. Ranveer displays his six packs and histrionics with fair ease. You have to also applaud Richa Chadda and Supriya Pathak Kapur for being the talent they are." 

Anupama Chopra of the Hindustan Times gave the movie 3 out of 5 stars and writes: "If Sanjay Leela Bhansali is to be believed, Gujaratis are the most colorful, passionate, violent, loud and lusty community in this country". She appreciates the directors aesthetic but also writes that "By the end, I was so exhausted that I just wanted all the Rajadis and Saneras to kill each other so that we could be done with it". 

Rajeev Masand of CNN-IBN gave the film 3.5 out of 5 stars. Appreciating the chemistry between the lead pair, he writes "Deepika and Ranveer scorch up the screen in their romantic scenes, their intense passion a bold change from Bollywoods mostly tame embraces." Masand concludes the review by stating "He (Bhansali) brings great style and aesthetic to an unapologetically commercial film, which Im happy to say is far more engaging than the lazy blockbusters weve seen lately." 
 DNA gave the movie 3.5 out of 5 stars and wrote "Ram Leela is a lovely mixture of the familiar and the fresh. The technical aspects of the film are extraordinary: breath-taking sets, spellbinding cinematography, perfect music and a wonderful supporting cast. Deepika is perfect in every scene. Ranveer has surrendered to the directors vision and delivers a power-packed performance. 
 Firstpost writes "Ram Leela has the soul of a cynical old noir peppered with a few small glimmers of masala. The direction, outstanding production design, gorgeous cinematography are supported by a surprisingly strong cast, and Padukone is a wild-eyed anchor in a sea of formula. Three years ago youd never have expected her to improve so drastically and command the kind of energy she does now. Ranveer, on the other hand, is a weak link. 

Shubhra Gupta of The Indian Express gave the movie 2.5 out of 5 stars, concluding "Ram-Leela creates a couple that ignites the screen, and most of the time when these two are on screen, you keep watching. Its when the guns come on, and the gun-masters start roaring and shouting, that the love-story drowns, and everything gets both too noisy and too choreographed." 

Sukanya Verma of Rediff.com gave the movie 2.5 out of 5 stars and wrote "Ram-Leela is a lavish visual spread and is filled with moments of thrill, ingenuity and splendour but falters somewhere due to Sanjay Leela Bhansalis confused priorities and half-hearted romanticism." She praised Padukones performance by stating "Still, its ever so watchable for Deepika Padukone. If ever there was any room for doubt, Deepika cancels it with her recently acquired aura. She embodies the lack of reason, the all-consuming junoon, the bitterness, the sauciness, the arrogance that constitutes Leela so effectively, the film could well be titled after her. Only her." 

Raja Sen, in a more unfavourable review at Rediff.com, rated the movie at 1 out of 5 stars. While lamenting the recent slew of Shakespearean travesties in Bollywood, he states that Ram-Leela is "silly, wasteful, loud" in addition to being "an overplotted, bloody mess". He is critical of Bhansalis attempt at depicting the violent world of Ranjaar with dialogues which are "very poor indeed, awful rhymes alternated with soap-operatic exposition". Commenting on the cast, he says that Ranveer Singh "plays Ram, and he does so head and shoulders more effeminately than you’ve seen any Hindi film hero" and "speaks like a character written for Satish Kaushik in a David Dhawan movie, all poor puns and weird vocal tics and very lame dialogue". Padukone, he observes, "looks absolutely luminous but can’t quite handle the sheer, relentless raunch the part demands", while, "Performers like Supriya Pathak and Gulshan Devaiah are reduced to cardboard caricatures and hamming, and the ever-effective Richa Chaddha isn’t given elbow room." 

===International=== Dawn gave Hum Dil De Chukay Sanam” and “Devdas (2002 Hindi film)|Devdas”. If the cinematic maven would have stuck to the former, the films attraction wouldnt only have to rely on superficial physical lure, and later, the tendency to go bloody boom. It would have simply been an instant classic". 

Danny Bowes, a New York-based critic, journalist and blogger whose reviews are published on Rogerebert.com, gave the film 3 out of 4 stars, stating "What makes the ride as enjoyable as it is, and what truly give focus to Bhansalis lush, colorful compositions, are the performances of Ranveer Singh and Deepika Padukone in the leads. Singh prevails over a very odd (even by masala hero standards) mustache to give a deeply affecting and rich performance as Ram, but its Padukone, as is increasingly the case, who steals the show with pure, deliberate, ferocious star power. The striking thing about her performance as Leela is how tightly coiled and tense it seems; shes ready at a moments notice to kiss or kill (or both), never passive, never merely a photographic subject."
