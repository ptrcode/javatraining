}} satirical comedy film co-written, directed by, and starring Mel Brooks, and released by 20th Century Fox on June 17, 1976. The ensemble cast includes Dom DeLuise, Marty Feldman, Bernadette Peters, and Sid Caesar, with appearances by Anne Bancroft, Liza Minnelli, Burt Reynolds, James Caan, Marcel Marceau and Paul Newman playing themselves.

While indeed silent (except for one word, music and numerous sound effects), the film is a parody of the silent film genre, particularly the slapstick comedies of Charlie Chaplin, Mack Sennett, and Buster Keaton. Among the films most famous gags is the fact that the only audible word in the movie is spoken by Marcel Marceau, a noted mime.
 San Francisco", only to have it come to a sudden stop as if the musicians realize they are playing the wrong music. They then go into "Manhattan (song)|Ill Take Manhattan" instead.

A play on the current trend of large corporations buying up movie studios is parodied in this film by the attempt of the Engulf and Devour Corporation to take control of a studio (a thinly veiled reference to Gulf+Westerns takeover of Paramount Pictures).

==Plot== Ron Carey), rejects the idea, but Funn convinces him that if he can get Hollywoods biggest stars to be in the film, he could save the studio.

Funn, Eggs, and Bell proceed to recruit various people for the film. Their first target is   is seen on the hospital grounds. After leading them on a wild Hollywood-style chase in electric wheelchairs, he asks to be in the film. Funn and company reply with the typical Hollywood-esque "Well get back to you." In the next shot, a newspaper ad indicates that they "ink" Newman to do the movie.

In the process of their search for stars, the trio have a number of brief but funny misadventures, including a mixup between two German Shepherds (one trained as a seeing-eye dog, the other most assuredly not), a flying blueberry pie, and several (mostly unsuccessful) efforts by Marty Eggs to seduce various women. Their most notable encounter involves a Coca Cola machine that dispenses cans by launching them like grenades.

Engulf and Devour, meanwhile, worry that Funn will save Big Picture Studios and they will be unable to buy it. They attempt to "stop Funn with sex" by sending voluptuous nightclub sensation Vilma Kaplan (  sober him up. Funns silent movie is completed in record time. Unfortunately, the only copy of it is stolen from the theater by Engulf & Devour just before its big premiere.

Vilma volunteers to stall the movie theaters audience with her nightclub act while Funn and his associates go out to steal back their film. They succeed, but are chased by Engulf and Devours thuggish executives. They are eventually cornered, but fortunately they are near the violent Coke machine, which they use against their foes. Most of the executives, including Mr. Devour, are disabled by the exploding cans of Coke, allowing Funn, Eggs, and Bell to escape. They hurry the film to the theater, where it is shown for the first time. In the meantime, Eggs has gotten himself tangled up in the film and he is immediately rushed up to the projection booth with the film wrapped around him.  After the movie is over, the audience applauds wildly and leaps to its feet while balloons and streamers fill the air. "They seem to like it," Funn says.

The film ends with the jubilant audience filing out of the theater past Funn, Eggs, Bell, Vilma, and the recovered studio chief. At the end, a title card is shown: "This was a true story."

==Analysis== color and Ron Clark late night television. Jenkins (2013), p. 165-168 

The film features an unflattering portrayal of the film industry. Big Picture Studios front gate sign boasts of the multi-million dollar scope of their films, never mentioning their quality. The film project is green-lit not on the merits of its script, but solely on the drawing power of the movie stars attached. Executives cannot tell good film footage apart from bad, while the Current Studio Chief is one box office bomb away from losing his position. The studio itself is under threat of a takeover by a "soulless" Conglomerate (company)|conglomerate. The movie stars are portrayed as vain figures who flaunt their wealth. The film audience is portrayed as fickle and unpredictable. Crick (2002), p. 84-100 

The villainous conglomerate Engulf & Devour is a parody of real-life conglomerate Gulf and Western Industries|Gulf+Western Industries, which had acquired Paramount Pictures. Crick (2002), p. 84-100  The film also parodies corporate executives as essentially interchangeable yes-men, following the whims of their boss. Crick (2002), p. 84-100 
 MGM lion. It depicts the Studio Chief (Sid Caesar) as a braying donkey. Crick (2002), p. 84-100  Liza Minnelli features in a scene which makes no use of her dancing talents. Robert Alan Crick points out that the part could be easily played by any well-known actress of the 1970s, with no apparent difference. Crick (2002), p. 84-100  The film was the first notable acting role for Brooks, who was previously limited to off-screen voiceovers and short cameos. Crick (2002), p. 84-100 

One joke makes use of the difference between the expressive gestures of silent cinema and those used in guessing games, such as charades. A secretary attempts to explain to the Studio Chief that Funn has a drinking problem, by pantomiming an uplifted bottle. Her boss misunderstands, figuring that Funn sucks his thumb.  Another scene with the Boss pays homage to slapstick. The boss proclaims slapstick to be dead. Then he flips his chair backwards, and goes sliding across the room. He slams his head, with the sound of a bell ringing. The humor of the scene derives from the combination of the image and the unlikely sound.  Many of the gags of the film actually depend on careful synchronizations of sound and image. For example, a sequence has Feldman tossed about between elevator doors. It is set to the sounds of a pinball machine. 

Other gags are delivered through intertitles. For example, in a meeting of Engulf & Devour, an underling whispers something in the ears of his boss. The intertitles report: "whisper...whisper...whisper". The boss fails to understand, forcing the man to shout. In response the intertitle is written in all caps: "YOUR FLY IS OPEN". 

Marcel Marceau reprises his "walking into the wind" routine while trying to lift a phone. He then shouts the only spoken word of the film: "non". Mel Funn does not apparently understand the reply, since he does not speak French. 

==Production notes== John Morriss score, "like a rug from beginning to end, just to be on the safe side."
* Even though the film was shot without sound, Brooks was initially frustrated when he could not get the film crew to laugh, as they were afraid their laughter would spoil a take.
* Brooks biographer James Robert Parish says that Brooks based the Eggs and Bell characters on his relationship with his three brothers.
* This was Brookss first starring role in a film; referring to himself as actor-director, Brooks said, "Im not going to tell myself how much I like me or Ill ask for more money."
* The pregnant woman in the first scene is Dom DeLuises real-life wife, Carol Arthur.

==Reception== The Producers (1968). Ebert (2007), p. 701-702  He also praised the film for offering an encyclopedia-worth of visual gags, both old and new. Ebert (2007), p. 701-702 

It earned North American rentals of $21,240,000.
