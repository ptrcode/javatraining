Ben shows the box to his friends, and the very same night the box is stolen. Soon after that, his closest friends start dying in mysterious ways. Le Vaudou Mort is actually a "Haitian Vodou|voodoo" machine designed as a tool for revenge. When the targets photograph is put into the box, a wax doll is created, giving the user power to kill or physically harm the represented person. A killer has started to use the device against Ben’s friends.

Ben, still unaware of the nature of the box and of the fact that it has been stolen, shows some picture of Le Vaudou Mort to Professor Banyon, his archaeology teacher, seeking information on the origins of the box. Professor Baynon contacts Dr. Halmanay, who provides to Ben some clues on the origins and uses of the box.

Ben and his brother Marcus (Travis Fimmel), who has not been forgiven by Ben since their father died in a car accident after a harsh discussion with him, figure out the power of the device and search for the killer.
