== Plot ==
Renouncing her sinful past Emanuelle (Laura Gemser) moves into a convent and becomes a nun, dedicating her life to religion and rejecting sin. Monika (Mónica Zanchi) a free-spirited daughter of a rich Baron joins the convent. She tells one sister how she was sexually assaulted by a group of young men (from a flashback sequence we learn that she actually consented and encourages them to make advances at her by revealing her breasts); this gains her sympathy from her fellow sisters.  Monika has sex and performs various sex acts with various men in and around the convent. Various nuns witness this causing them to question their faith and break their repression. Monika has a sexual relationship with another sister and blackmails her (by refusing sex) if she does not comply with her demands. Later a mysterious man, armed with a gun visits the convent. He has sex with Monika; witnessed by most nuns in the convent. Monika is later dismissed. Emanuelle later leaves at her own free-will.
