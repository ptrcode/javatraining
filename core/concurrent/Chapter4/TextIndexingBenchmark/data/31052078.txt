==Plot==
Michael Finnegan, a past-his-prime journalist, has been relegated to ghost-writing Dear Felicity, a column for the lovelorn. He and his wife live in a decaying neighborhood; his wife, still despondent over losing their young son, lives in a fantasy world. Despite these reversals, Finnegan retains his optimism: he knows human beings begin again, and again. He gets his own chance to begin again when, one day on the bus, he meets Liz DeHaan, an art teacher who is having an affair with a married man.
