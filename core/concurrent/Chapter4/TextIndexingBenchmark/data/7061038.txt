A long-time engineer and producer for Atlantic Records, Tom Dowd was responsible for some of the most important R&B, Rock music|rock, and jazz records ever made. In his own words, Tom Dowd relates how he went from working on the Manhattan Project as rising physicist, while still high school age, to recording some of the greatest music ever made over the last half of the 20th Century.  His technical genius opened the door to modern music and made the studio a crucial element in the formula of musical artistry.  His use of the multitrack eight-track tape recorder at Atlantic Records in the late 50s not only added an amazing dimension to the sound of music (hes also credited with taking music recording from monaural to stereo), it also gave musicians and producers greater control over their musical productions and identities.  For the first time, it was possible to isolate musical sounds and then manipulate (mix) its parts in the recording process.

The movie  , provides a demonstration of how Tom Dowds genius escalated musical artistry and revved up the popular music industry. In one scene, Tom Dowd is shown in the studio directing the recording of Ray Charles music for Atlantic Records executive Ahmet Ertegun.  After Ray dismisses his backup singers, the Raelettes, because of tension with Margie Hendricks, the lead Raelette, Dowd plays back whats been recorded thus far and Ray instantly picks up a difference in the sound.  Dowd explains the companys new eight-track console and Ray wastes no time exploiting it to his advantage.  He instantly resumes the recording session by performing the required Raelettes parts himself, assured that Dowd can mix each track to produce the final record.
