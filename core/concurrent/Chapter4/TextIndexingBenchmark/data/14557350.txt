Tricky Dicks is the 147th short subject starring American slapstick comedy team The Three Stooges. The trio made a total of 190 shorts for Columbia Pictures between 1934 and 1959.

==Plot==
The Stooges are detectives who have nearly mastered the game of Gin Rummy. They are frequently interrupted by a very loudly ringing telephone. Shemp brings in the pickpocket Slick Chick (Connie Cezan) who manages to talk her way out of the station. Shemp joins the Gin Rummy game before the three of them tangle with a very stubborn filing cabinet. 

After nearly finishing the game, the Stooges police chief B. A. Copper (  confession ("I am the culprit who perpetrated this heinous incident!") confuses the simple-minded Stooges, who insist he is avoiding the question. Frustrated, the Stooges throw Chopper back in a jail cell.  Larry kisses a female officer who promptly slaps him.

A pedestrian, (Murray Alper), shows up wanting to talk to them, but is thrown out by an angry Moe, (who has apparently warned him several times before that they were too busy to listen) and warned to get out and stay out.

The next man they bring up is a witness, an organ grinder with a monkey named Antonio Zucchini Salami Gorgonzola dePizza (Benny Rubin). The witness begins to download his information to the Stooges, but his Italian looks do not match the English cockney accent that comes out of his mouth.  When Moe asks him what he was doing at the time of the murder, dePizza flees in terror at the thought of blood.

Next, Shemp takes a call regarding a dismissed bootlegging charge, stating "The D.A. says we cant make a case out of 11 bottles" (!). Just when all seems lost Larry returns with Chopper who says he wants to confess to the murder. However, while taking down his confession, the real killer finally shows up (Murray Alper). Upset that Chopper is going to take the credit of the murder away from him, he pulls out a gun and starts shooting everything in site. The Stooges take cover in their office, as the killer shoots over 60 times without reloading.  Everyone is trapped until dePizzas monkey drops several bowling balls on the killers head, knocking him cold.
