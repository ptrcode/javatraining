==Summary== Israeli family. While other nine have all extended the family tree by marrying and having children, David, at twenty-nine, still hasnt brought home a girlfriend, which inspires his familys constant nagging. The confessional film follows David as he takes small steps, gathering courage, and hoping to receive acceptance from his family.

Throughout the film the importance of marriage is made clear. In one scene Davids mother is shown lighting candles as she prays for her children in a hushed tone: "save them from bombing accidents; let them all marry and have children."

Set in Tel Aviv, Say Amen explores the varying ideologies regarding homosexuality that are present in Israel today. Many religions interpret that the book of Leviticus from the Bible as describing homosexuality as an "abomination" thats punishable by death, although this has been debated for quite some time. {{cite web

  Today there is a growing sympathy within Judaism towards homosexuals, spurred by some peoples beliefs that homosexuality is not a chosen act of sin. Despite these progressive attitudes, Orthodox Judaism generally prohibits homosexual conduct and views it with condescension and disgust.

David is brave enough to share his struggles, but, for the most part, hes still too shy to step out from behind the camera. His family is irritated by his constant filming, but it works to the documentarys advantage. By turning the lens away from himself, David completely avoids self-indulgent emotionality, maintaining a sense of objectivity. This technique also allows the viewer sees the world through his eyes. The frustrated looks, the sad sighs, and the lectures are all addressed to the camera, making it easy for the viewer to imagine how David must feel.

Say Amen impresses the importance of family. In between their serious conversations, the documentary captures ordinary moments the Deri family spends together. The entire Dari extended family gathers to celebrate a grandchilds birthday, David dances with his mother in the kitchen, and little kids climb all over the couch where their mother is sitting and yawning. The comfort is apparent, making Davids isolating secret all the more painful. {{cite web
