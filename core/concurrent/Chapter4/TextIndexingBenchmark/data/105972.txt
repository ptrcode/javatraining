==Plot==
In 1978, narcissistic, manipulative Madeline Ashton performs in a musical on Broadway theatre|Broadway. Madeline invites long-time rival Helen Sharp, an aspiring writer, backstage along with her fiancé, plastic surgeon Ernest Menville. Ernest is smitten with Madeline, soon breaking off his engagement with Helen to marry her. Seven years later, Helen is in a psychiatric hospital after fixating upon Madeline. Obese and depressed, Helen feigns rehabilitation and is released, plotting revenge on Madeline.
 reconstructive mortician. Receiving an invitation to a party celebrating Helens new book, Madeline rushes to a spa where she regularly receives extensive facial treatments. Understanding Madelines situation, the spa owner gives her the business card of Lisle von Rhoman, a woman who specializes in youth rejuvenation. Madeline dismisses the spa owners advice.

Madeline and Ernest attend the party for Helens novel Forever Young and discover Helen is thin and youthful. Dumbfounded and depressed by Helens appearance, Madeline goes to see her young lover but discovers he is with a woman his own age. Dejected, Madeline drives to Lisles home. Lisle is a mysterious, wealthy socialite who claims to be 71, but appears much younger, and reveals to Madeline the secret of her beauty: a potion that promises eternal life and an ever-lasting youthful appearance. Madeline purchases and drinks the potion and is rejuvenated. As a condition of purchase, Madeline must disappear from public life after ten years to keep the existence of the potion secret. Lisle warns Madeline to take good care of her body.

Helen has seduced Ernest and convinced him to kill Madeline. When Madeline returns home, she and Ernest argue, during which Madeline falls down the stairs and breaks her neck. Believing Madeline dead, Ernest phones Helen for advice, not seeing Madeline stand and approach him with her head twisted backwards. Ernest assumes she has a dislocated neck and drives her to the emergency room. Madeline is told she is technically dead and faints. She is taken to the morgue due to her body having no pulse and a temperature below 80°F. After rescuing Madeline, Ernest takes the sign of her "resurrection" as a miracle, returns home with Madeline and uses his skills to repair her body.

Helen arrives home, demanding information about Madelines situation. Overhearing Helen and Ernest discussing their plot to stage Madelines death, Madeline shoots Helen with a double-barreled shotgun. Although the blast causes a gaping hole in her stomach, Helen survives, revealing that she drank the same potion. Fed up with the pair, Ernest prepares to leave but Helen and Madeline convince him to do one last repair on their bodies. They realize their bodies will need constant maintenance and scheme to have Ernest drink the potion to ensure he will always be available.

After bringing Ernest to Lisle, she offers to give him the potion free of charge. Ernest refuses; he would rather live a normal life than spend an eternity with Madeline and Helen. He pockets the potion and flees, but becomes trapped on the roof. Helen and Madeline implore Ernest to drink the potion to survive an impending fall. Ernest refuses, but after falling he lands in Lisles pool and escapes. After Lisle banishes Madeline and Helen from her group, the pair realize they must rely on each other for companionship and maintenance.

Thirty-seven years later, Madeline and Helen attend Ernests funeral, where he is eulogized as having lived an adventurous and fulfilling life. The two bicker as they leave Ernests funeral. They are parodies of their former selves, with cracked, peeling paint and putty covering most of their grey and rotting flesh. Helen trips, leaving her teetering at the top of a staircase. After she hesitates to help her companion, Helen grabs Madeline and the two tumble down the stairs, breaking to pieces. As their disembodied heads roll and totter together, Helen sardonically asks Madeline, "Do you remember where you parked the car?"

==Special effects==
 
Death Becomes Her was a technically complex movie to make, and the production had a fair number of mishaps.  For example, in a scene where Helen Sharp and Madeline Ashton are battling with shovels, Meryl Streep accidentally cut Goldie Hawns face, leaving a faint scar.  Despite the film winning an Academy Award for its effects, Streep admitted that she disliked working on a project that focused so heavily on special effects, saying:

 My first, my last, my only. I think its tedious. Whatever concentration you can apply to that kind of comedy is just shredded. You stand there like a piece of machinery—they should get machinery to do it. I loved how it turned out. But its not fun to act to a lampstand. "Pretend this is Goldie, right here! Uh, no, Im sorry, Bob, she went off the mark by five centimeters, and now her head wont match her neck!" It was like being at the dentist.  

Computer generated imagery (Computer Generated Imagery|CGI) by Industrial Light and Magic was used to create the skin effects, such as Madelines twisted neck and stretching skin, and the shotgun hole through Helens abdomen.
