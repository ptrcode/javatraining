== Critical reception ==

=== Kannada ===
Mythri received overwhelmingly positive reviews from critics. 

Deccan Chronicle|Deccan Chronicle rated 4.5 out of 5 stars and called it "Brilliant" and "The best sandalwood movie in the recent times" praising the screenplay, acting and direction "Mythri has none of the so-called ‘must-haves’ – like heroism, fights, lavish sets, glamour, masala and more importantly item songs for a box office.", "Giriraj has penned the script with utmost care while balancing the storyline while depicting it through sheer artistic excellence". 

The New Indian Express|The New Indian Express called it as "A feel good movie of our times" and said "This realistic film is important because of its combination of a social message with universal appeal" and stated "Mythri is one of the most sensible and a feel-good Kannada films in recent times. Giriraj’s film’s strengths lie in its narrative force combined with elements of joy, suspense and reality along with the overall vision of the director and the energy of the actors. The film boasts a good starcast with great music by Ilayaraaja" and praised its camera work, editing and cast performances including the kids. "The real star of the film is the content that creates a contrast between the rich and the poor. With the summer holidays just weeks away, Mythri can be one of the best holiday films for the entire family". 

Bangalore Mirror rated 4.5 out of 5 stars and said "Mythri is one of the most sensible films Sandalwood has churned out in recent years". And called it "A bond that lasts forever" "There is no masala elements, and yet Mythri is not an art film that was made for awards. It is silver screen magic in its truest sense that does not treat audience as dumb people who seem to be in need for superlative stimulants". "Giriraj chooses his subjects and characters well. Unlike regular commercial film-makers, he shows reality in human form. Giriraj deserves all the applause for his conviction and narrative style. This one is a total delight". 

Timesofap rated 4 out of 5 stars and elaborated "Mythri is a strong script about the life a junevile. Focusing on the dreadful social problems, Giriraj has wrote a wonderful story."&nbsp;"It is for the first time Puneeth Rajkumar is seen as an actor in a movie. Mohanlal is at his best in his character, Mohanlal and Veda Sastrys pairing up as a couple is feast for the viewers." "Mythri is a full package. It has good cinematography and very well written screenplay. The movie gets a ‘thumbs up for its technical aspects.&nbsp;Mythri has been successful to show the cruel reality of the society. Overall, Mythri is a best movie which ends with a special and a strong message to society". Also praised the music from Ilayaraaja.

The Times of India rated 4 out of 5 stars and said "Mythri is worth watching. After Jatta, director B M Giriraj and producer Rajkumar are back with another masterpiece.

Also praised the music from Ilayaraaja, cast performances and A. V Krishnakumars camera work. 

The Hindu stated "It is undoubtedly one of the most sensible films made in Kannada cinema in recent years. Mythri can be described as an attempt to silence those who argue that Kannada film is like stagnant water and that there are no experimental scripts. Still its not an art film, Mythri is a model of a perfect blend of art and commercial elements. 

NamCinema.com rated 4.5 out of 5 stars and concluded that "On the whole there are certain movies which give feel good factor when watched and Mythri surely is one such movie. Such movies should be made in future so that the positive intent of such movies should creep into people even if it means one or two would watch"
