Five people of Indian origin are killed in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, within a short period of time. At first, the attacks are believed to be racially motivated, but the investigating officer Anwar Ali (Sarath Kumar), a Tamilian of the Indian origin, feels that there are no grounds to believe that.

As he and his team investigate the Facebook profiles of the victims, they find a common factor: they all had a mutual friend called ‘Asha Black’. Asha (newcomer Ishitha Chauhan) is a 17-year-old girl addicted to making online friends and chatting with them 24/7. 

When an online romance blooms between ‘Asha Black’ and the Coimbatore-based young musician, Rohith (Arjun Lal), Rohith decides to go to Kuala Lumpur, and meet her on her eighteenth birthday.

Asha Black takes the viewer on a guided tour of the dark alleys of the World Wide Web, showing how the unmonitored use of the internet by young adults can make them prey to murky people who are supplying pornographic material on the Net,  or how unloved and neglected children become victims of sex abuse.
