The 10th Victim ( ) is a 1965 Italian/French international co-production science fiction film directed by Elio Petri and starring Marcello Mastroianni and Ursula Andress, and featuring Elsa Martinelli in a supporting role. The picture is based on Robert Sheckleys 1953 short story "Seventh Victim". Sheckley later published a novelization of the film in 1966,  and two sequels (Victim Prime and Hunter/Victim) in 1987 and 1988, respectively. 

==Plot==
In the near future, big wars are avoided by giving individuals with violent tendencies a chance to kill in the Big Hunt. The Hunt is the most popular form of entertainment in the world and also attracts participants who are looking for fame and fortune. It includes ten rounds for each competitor, five as the hunter and five as the victim. The survivor of ten rounds becomes extremely wealthy and retires. Scenes switch between the pursuit, romance between the hunter and the victim, and a narrator explaining the rules and justification of the Hunt.

==Plot differences from the original story==
The original short story was written from the point of view of a man hunting his seventh target, a woman, whereas in the movie she is the hunter.  He finds her apparently defenseless sitting in a cafe.  Talking to her, she tells him how she is new to the game but could not bear to kill her own target, and now expects to die.  The hunter falls in love with his victim, as in the movie, and eventually reveals who he is.  However he has been tricked. She shoots him, joining the ranks of the "Sevens".
