}} Argentine comedy drama film, directed by Carlos Sorín, and written by Sorín and Jorge Goldenberg.  The movie features Ulises Dumont, Julio Chávez, among others. 

==Plot==
The film tells the story of David Vass (Julio Chávez), an obsessed filmmaker who attempts to make an epic account of the French adventurer Orelie-Antoine de Tounens, who in 19th century assumed the title of  King of Patagonia and Araucanía (historic region)|Araucania.

Vass meets major obstacles at every turn during the film. First, word leaks out to the Argentine media that Vass is finally making his film and he has to dodge them as he executes his preproduction plans.

The big problem is finding the perfect actor to portray the king. When all of the professional auditions are rejected, Vass turns to the street. Unfortunately, he chooses a hippie type, who mistakes Vass for the cops and flees. Still, Vass catches up and convinces him to play the part.

Finally, Vass assembles cast and crew and prepares to go southern Argentina to shoot the film. However, his financial backer withdraws with the films money and flees abroad.  Now Vass has no money to pay his staff.

The actors immediately abandon the project and once again Vass hits the streets to find his actors.

Finally, the group makes it to the location for shooting. By this time they are so broke that they cannot afford lodging and end up staying at an orphanage until an actor makes the wrong advances towards a youngster and gets them kicked out.

The crew, not wanting to sleep in tents, decide to leave. The cast joins them. Despite this final crushing blow, Vass will not abandon the film and portrays the king himself, using mannequins for extras to create some of the films most haunting and surreal scenes.
