==Plot==
 
Milton Parker (Vincent Price), an elderly and eccentric game inventor, dies after losing a video game with his seductive nurse (Carol Wayne). Following his funeral, Parkers greedy and estranged relatives show up at his mansion for the reading of his will. They learn from lawyer Charles Bernstein (Robert Morley) that the winner of an elaborate scavenger hunt will inherit his $200 million estate. The  (potential) beneficiaries form five teams and get involved in various misadventures.

The five teams consist of:

# Parkers son-in-law Henry Motley (Tony Randall) and his four ill-behaved children.
# The servants: French cook Henri (James Coco), valet Jenkins (Roddy McDowall), limo driver Jackson (Cleavon Little), and French maid Babbette (Stephanie Faracy).
# Dim-witted taxi driver Marvin Dummittz (Richard Mulligan).
# Parkers greedy widowed sister Mildred Carruthers (Cloris Leachman), her equally greedy attorney Stewart Sellsome (Richard Benjamin), and her spoiled, man-child son Georgie (Richard Masur).
# Nephews Kenny (Dirk Benedict) and Jeff Stevens (Willie Aames), with Mildreds step-daughter Lisa (Maureen Teefy).

Each group is given five lists containing clues to acquire 100 items with various point values ranging from five to 100 points. The items are to be acquired by any means necessary, with the exception of being purchased. They are to be placed in five different pens on the grounds of the estate. The winner of the scavenger hunt will be the person or team to acquire the most points by 5 p.m. that day.

Chaos and carnage ensue, with scavengers returning occasionally to the Parker mansion to deposit items under the supervision of Bernstein and the scorekeeper, Cornfeld.

Mildred, Stewart and Georgies adventure has them trying to win a stuffed toy bear at a local carnival, trying to haul a heavy safe out of Stewarts office building, stealing the false teeth of a Native American (who spends the rest of the movie tracking them down), as well as resorting to stealing other peoples items. Stewart gets roughed up by a motorcycle gang led by a burly guy named Scum (Meat Loaf) after attempting to steal a stuffed fox tail from a biker.

The servants adventure has them trying to steal a toilet from a fancy hotel, partaking in a robbery at a convenience store to steal a cash register (sans the cash), and getting locked in a university laboratory while trying to steal a microscope.

Kenny, Jeff and Lisas adventure has them "borrowing" items such as a clown head from a local Jack in the Box eatery and recruiting an obese man named Duane (Stuart Pankin) (since the list gives 50 bonus points for bringing the heaviest person), although they soon discard him (due to his unreasonable bribes for food) and pick up another obese person. A bulletproof vest is borrowed from a self-defense-obsessed elderly lady named Arvila (Ruth Gordon) and they acquire "laughing gas," steal a uniform from a motorcycle cop, and get stuck in a football teams locker room trying to steal a helmet. 

Dummittz adventure has him trying unsuccessfully to steal a Rolls Royce front grill and getting run over many times. A bridal shop security guard named Sam (Scatman Crothers) catches him attempting to steal a bridal dress. Sam joins the hunt. Together they steal a knights suit of armor from a museum, with Marvin dressing up as a mummy and Sam putting on the armor. Sam is stolen by the Mildred-Stewart-Georgie team. Marvin then teams up with obese friend Merl (Stephen Furst).

Motleys adventure has him attempting to make his unruly kids proud while acquiring a beehive (he gets stung), a life preserver (he gets stranded), and a parachute (he gets a flat tire). Motley tries to get a medicine ball from a gym and to impress the instructor Lars (Arnold Schwarzenegger), which gets Motley thrown out of a second floor window trying to catch a medicine ball thrown to him.

Each team steals an ostrich from the San Diego Zoo, much to the dismay of the bewildered zookeeper (Avery Schreiber).

It all leads to a climactic car chase back to the Parker mansion. Some give up their individual chances to win in order to help Kenny, Jeff and Lisa win against the unethical Mildred-Stewart-Georgie team. With seconds to go, Sam, still wearing the armor, has to crawl out of the Carruthers pen and into the other pen to win the contest for the Stevens brothers and Lisa. The victors decide to share their new wealth with the rest, except for Mildred, Stewart and Georgie.
