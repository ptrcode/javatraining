==Plot==
Frank Rhino Rhinoslavsky (Quinn) is a dumb part-time cab driver in New York who wants to break into film business. He doesnt have anything to offer, and just thinks that he can start at the top, as a writer. Opportunity knocks on Franks door when he goes to the Cannes Film Festival in Cannes, France to deliver some props to Troma, Inc.

So, he meets Sy Lerner (Seymor Cassel), perhaps a bigger loser in movie business and as each person interviewed in this mockumentary, he has made a fool out of a lot of industry executives and cost them plenty of money. Lerner makes a bet with his friend that he can take any shmoe off the street and turn them into the biggest success around. And Frank is his shmoe. Rhino is going to create the same success by letting others do all the work. 

Sy Lerner takes on Frank as his pet project. He shows Frank how to dress and behave, tells him how to respond when being interviewed such as never saying too much, and always being ambiguous. Then Sy Lerner comes up with the vehicle for Franks reputation, by naming him the writer of a new movie. Only the movie doesnt exist and Frank isnt a writer. And, even knowing Lerners reputation, people buy into the garbage. And now, everyone wants a piece of that action. Lerner and Frank (now given a fitting industry name of "Frank Rhino") have everyone knocking down their door, popular directors, big name producers, and famous actors (including Johnny Depp and Jim Jarmusch). Interviews, press opportunities, everything: Frank is the "Cannes Man," and he didnt have to do much to get it. So, they are at the Cannes Film Festival. Its where deals get made, producers get laid, and stars get paid. Its where all the movie industry meets to buy and sell all the movies on the planet. And its where the art of the deal can be filled with more laughs than the deal itself.

==Location==
The film was shot in Cannes, Alpes-Maritimes, France. 

==Critical reception==
Cannes Man was generally given mixed reviews by critics. Film review aggregate website Rotten Tomatoes gave the film a "rotten" score of 50% based on 6 reviews. Clint Morris from Moviehole said Richard Martini really knows Hollywood - if youre a fan of The Player, youll love this. Youll see more stars in this than you will outside the window of a space ship! for that film.  Peter Nichols of the New York Times deemed it "One of this years small treasures" when released to video in 1997.
