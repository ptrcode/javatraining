Jersey Girl is a 2004 American comedy-drama film written, co-edited, and directed by Kevin Smith. It stars Ben Affleck, Liv Tyler, Raquel Castro, George Carlin, Jason Biggs, Jennifer Lopez and Will Smith.

It is also the second film by Smith not to be set in the View Askewniverse and the first not to feature appearances by Jay and Silent Bob, although animated versions of them appear in the View Askew logo. It is the second film where Ben Affleck and Liv Tyler play a couple, the previous being in the 1998 film Armageddon (1998 film)|Armageddon.

==Plot== media Public publicist in Independence Day in front of assembled reporters. The outburst costs him his job, so he moves in with his father in New Jersey. He eventually apologizes for ignoring his daughter, and attributes his public outburst to his grief.

Blacklisted by all of New York Citys public relations firms, Ollie has to work as a civil servant in the borough where he now lives with his father. Seven years later, Gertie (Raquel Castro), now in elementary school, often coaxes him to rent films to watch. At the video store, they meet Maya (Liv Tyler), one of the stores clerks, whose uninhibited probing into Ollies love life almost leads to them having casual sex. She soon becomes a part of their lives.

As part of his job in the borough, Ollie speaks to a group of outraged citizens to win over their approval for a major public works project that will temporarily close a street in the neighborhood. His successful and enjoyable interaction with the crowd leads him to realize how much he misses the public relations work. He contacts Arthur (Jason Biggs), his one-time protégé, who sets up a promising interview.

The prospect of moving to New York creates tension among Ollie, Gertie, Bart, and Maya, especially when he says that his interview is on the same day as Gerties school talent show. She yells at him, saying she hates him and that she wishes he had died instead of her mom. He claims he hates her right back, and says she and Gertrude took his life away and he just wants it back. He immediately regrets it and tries to apologize, but the damage is done and she pushes him away and runs to her room, crying. A few days later he and Gertie finally patch things up, and she accepts the fact that they will be moving to New York. While waiting to be interviewed, he has a chance encounter with Will Smith (playing himself), the man he trashed at his public outburst years before. Smith has no idea who Ollie is, but the two spark a conversation about work and children.
 Sweeney Todd performance at the last moment. The film ends with him, Gertie, Bart, Maya, and the rest celebrating at the bar. He and Maya hint at possible feelings for each other before being interrupted by Gertie. He holds her and says that they are staying in New Jersey because he did not take the job. She asks why he did so if he loved it so much. He says that he thought he did, but he loved his new life more because being a father to her was the only thing that he was ever really good at.

==Pre-production==
The films budget included $10 million for Afflecks salary, and $4 million for Lopez. 

In the original draft of the script, Bruce Willis rather than Will Smith was the cause of (and eventual resolution to) Ollies problems. Smith wrote the first fifty pages of the script with Bill Murray and Joey Lauren Adams in mind.

 its high school after him. Scenes that were shot there include those in its Municipal Building, Clam Digger Bar, and High School. Also cut from the film, are scenes in Paulsboros St. Johns Church and Little League Field. The scene in the church was to show the marriage between Jennifer Lopez and Ben Afflecks characters. However, it was cut out of the film shortly after the split between them and scenes reshot, reducing her part into a cameo, due to concern over the poor box office reception of Gigli.  

== Release ==
The film is Smiths first to have received a Motion Picture Association of America film rating system|PG-13 rating. It was originally given an R rating  due to the dialogue with Ollie and Maya discussing masturbation in the diner,  but that decision was overturned.

An extended cut was shown at Kevin Smiths private film festival Vulgarthon in 2005 and 2006. The extended version included a much longer extension of the Jennifer Lopez section of the film, Ben Afflecks full speech in the city hall, a longer ending, and some music changes. 

On the films audio commentary, Smith stated that a longer version of the film would be released within the next year. At a Q&A session in Vancouver in early 2009, Smith said that a release of the extended cut on DVD and Blu-ray Disc is "very possible".

On the second episode of the podcast "Blow Hard with Malcolm Ingram", Smith tells a story of Malcolm sending him lyrics to "Landslide" by Fleetwood Mac trying to apologize for an earlier incident. He was so touched by the email that he included this song in the films soundtrack. 

== Reception ==
===Critical reception===
Critical response was mixed, with critics denoting it as being formulaic, though some critics (including Roger Ebert) commended Kevin Smith for trying different things in his film career.   Smith was quoted saying his film was "not for critics". 

  

The film was nominated for three   for Best Performance in a Feature Film – Young Actress Age Ten or Younger for her performance and the film was nominated for Best Family Feature Film – Comedy or Musical, but lost to Christmas with the Kranks. 

Kevin Smiths reaction to Jersey Girl after its failure was dour. Smith references this film during his cameo appearance in  ; he jokingly tells Paige Michalchuk, whom he cut out of his fictional film Jay and Silent Bob Go Canadian, Eh!, that he cut Lopez out of half of Jersey Girl and wanted to cut Affleck out too "but then it just would have been that little kid".  In an interview from the Clerks II DVD, Smith noted "All these people were just trashing this movies stars instead of looking at the movie itself. I get that a lot of people didnt like it but dude, I spent two years of my life on that movie." 

===Box office performance===
The film made $25.2 million at the North American domestic box office and $10.8 million internationally against a $35 million budget    and a $15 million marketing campaign.
