==Plot==
A well-dressed, barrel-chested man enters the New York City subway at midnight and stalks the late-night passengers of a subway train. He assaults and kills several people with a meat hammer and a butchers hook. He dispatches his prey wordlessly, and with an unnatural strength. He wears a ring on his finger, adorned with an eight pointed star.

Leon is a vegan amateur photographer who wants to find unique spots of the NYC landscape to shoot, and at the advice of his contractor heads into the citys subway system at night. He is criticized constantly by other photographers for fleeing danger before shooting a full reel. One night, in a decision to break this trend, he saves a woman from a gang that is abusing her. The next day, he discovers this girl has gone missing. Leon is intrigued by the mystery, and begins to investigate newsreels about similar disappearances. His investigation leads him to a butcher named Mahogany, whom he suspects has been killing subway passengers for the past three years.

Leon attempts to turn some of the photos he has taken of Mahogany in to the police, but they refuse to believe him, and instead cast suspicion on his own motives in photographing the victims. Leons involvement quickly turns into a dark obsession, upsetting his waitress girlfriend Maya, who is as disbelieving of his story as the police chief. Leon takes matters into his own hands, entering the subway train at midnight, only to witness a shocking bloodbath, as the butcher kills several passengers, then hangs them on meat hooks. Passing out on the subway floor, he awakes the next morning in a slaughterhouse with strange markings carved into his chest.

A concerned Maya and her friend Jurgis begin to examine the photos Leon has been taking of Mahogany, leading them to the killers apartment. After breaking into the butchers home, Jurgis is captured, and brutally killed. Maya goes to the police, but finds that they are as unwilling to consider her story as they were of Leons. A police official then directs Maya to a trip on the midnight train. Leon, unaware of Mayas involvement, finally decides to put an end to the butchers crimes. Leon heads to the hidden subway entrance in the slaughterhouse, arming himself with several slaughterhouse knives, and wearing a butchers apron.

Leon enters the train as Mahogany has completed his nightly massacre, and has cornered a helpless Maya. Leon attacks the murderer with a knife, beginning a climactic battle between the photographer and the butcher. They fight in between the swinging human flesh—Leons knives against Mahoganys meat hammer—and human body parts are ripped, thrown, and used as weapons. Finally, Mahogany is thrown out of the train by Leon, but not long before it hits its final stop. The train has entered an underground cavern, filled with skulls and decomposing bodies. The conductor of the train enters the car, advising Leon and Maya to "Please step away from the meat." With these words, the true purpose of the underground station is revealed, as horrible reptilian creatures enter the car, consuming the meat. Leon and Maya leave the carriage into the cavern. 

Mahogany, in a battered and bleeding state, returns, barely alive, and engages in a death struggle with Leon, who finishes the job at last by impaling the psychotic butchers skull on a blade. Mahogany grins in his dying throes, speaking the single word "Welcome!"

The conductor appears and explains to Leon that the creatures have always existed below the city, and that the butchers job was to keep them satisfied by feeding them every night. He picks up Leon, and with the same supernatural strength as the deceased butcher, rips out Leons tongue, throwing him to the ground and eating the tongue. The conductor brings Leons attention to Maya, who has been knocked unconscious and is lying on a pile of bones - presumably this took place some time during Leons fight with the butcher. The conductor then forces Leon to watch as he kills Maya with one of the butchers knives. When he is done, He tells Leon that, having killed the butcher, he must take his place.

Finally, the police chief hands the train schedule to the new butcher, who wears a ring with the eight pointed star on it, a symbol for the group that feeds the creatures. The killer walks onto the midnight train, and turns his head to reveal that the new butcher is Leon.

An internet campaign was started by several horror websites to draw attention to the scaled-down theatrical release. 
 The Strangers, where he received a producing credit: "The politics that are being visited upon it have nothing to do with the movie at all. This is all about ego, and though I mourn the fact that The Midnight Meat Train was never given its chance in theaters, it’s a beautifully stylish, scary movie, and it isn’t going anywhere. People will find it, and whether they find it in midnight shows or they find it on DVD, they’ll find it, and in the end the Joe Drakes of the world will disappear." 
 rating of R18+ for high level violence, blood and gore. DVD and Blu-ray releases followed on 14 July.

==Reception==
Critical reaction to The Midnight Meat Train has been mostly positive; IGN said, "Director Ryuhei Kitamura ... brings an incredible level of polish and visual sophistication to what is essentially a mid-range script. ... Theres an energy to the films final 10 minutes thats unmatched in recent horror films, and Kitamuras penchant for hard-hitting action, while suitably controlled, is always just below the surface. ... Overall, The Midnight Meat Train is a simple, bloody, hardcore offering certain to satisfy fans of the genre."  Twitch Film said, "On most counts, The Midnight Meat Train succeeds. Its visually engrossing, the acting and story are (mostly) solid and it has a great lead villain in Vinnie Jones.  It only falters in an illogical last act. No matter, the gore factor is selling point to the genre crowd and they dont have to worry. No punches are pulled. If this is the kind of quality material that Kitamuras going to deliver in Hollywood, I hope he stays there." 

Cinematical called the film "easily the best Clive Barker adaptation since the first Hellraiser film," saying that "screenwriter Jeff Buhler manages to maintain the sly sense of dread that permeates the best of Barkers horror tales."  Bloody Disgusting said that "Clive Barker fans will rejoice in what director Ryuhei Kitamura has given them. In the Japanese directors first English-language film, he has taken his visual genius from Alive (2002 film)|Alive and Versus (film)|Versus and translated it into an action-packed blood fest. It has been a long time since a major horror film has been given such loving treatment by its director."  Conversely, DVD Talk said that while the story is "an interesting concept," its "subpar" compared to the rest of Clive Barkers work, and criticized the films "melodrama" and computer-generated effects. 

The film currently holds a 71% "fresh" rating on Rotten Tomatoes; the consensus states: "A creative and energetic adaptation of a Clive Barker short story, with enough scares and thrills to be a potential cult classic."
