Nurse Edith Mortley opens the door, stabs the lieutenant, and has her brother, Doctor Gordon Mortley, place the mans body in the garage.

== Reception ==
 padded and hilariously inept "assault on the senses". 
 Criminally Insane (1973) and Satans Black Wedding (1974); passing them off as Ediths nightmares. Since this is a follow-up, hes also able to pad things out even further by including clips from the first Death Nurse to help push the run-time up to a paltry 60 minutes. Again, theres a new title card for the film, but the same credits from Criminally Insane are re-run. The music from that film is also reused. Its set in the same exact Pepto Bismol-colored San Francisco house the other movies are set in, features most of the same actors from the other movies and features the same aluminum foil-covered weapons for the close-up hacking/stabbing scenes. There are countless zoom shots, many close-ups of Ediths scowling face and numerous scenes of people sitting, sleeping, lounging on a couch or walking through the house that never seem to end".
