  American short short drama dramatic silent Princess Red Wing as "White Fawn", the lead woman does not fit St. Cyrs description.  The movie was shot in New Jersey at 24fps.   

White Fawns Devotion is the earliest surviving film directed by a Native American.  It was one of the earlier films shot in America by the French company Pathé.  A reviewer in the New York Dramatic Mirror wrote that the film "proves to be interesting if we can forget the New Jersey scenery" and noted that "it is not quite clear where the devotion comes in, nor of what it consists.". 

In 2008, the movie was added to the United States National Film Registry as being deemed "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant".

 

==Plot==
When a settler in the Dakotas gets word that he is to inherit a large fortune, his Native American wife is upset.  Believing that she will lose her husband if he returns East, she stabs herself with a knife.  Her husband finds her and removes the knife, but their daughter see him with the knife in his hand and her apparently dead mother.  The child, believing the father committed the murder, alerts the nearby Indian village. Several Indians then engage the settler in a long chase. When the settler is captured, the Indians intend to put him to death until White Fawn miraculously revives and informs the Indians of the truth.

==Production==
James Young Deer (also known as J. Younger Johnston or James Young Johnson), the uncredited director and writer of White Fawns Devotion, was believed to be the first Native American film director.  His ancestors were members of the Nanticoke people of Delaware.   Young Deer was hired by Pathé Frères as a director and scenario writer and frequently worked in collaboration with his actress wife Lillian St. Cyr, also known by her stage name Princess Red Wing. Out of the more than 100 short and a few feature films he made, White Fawns Devotion is one of fewer than 10 films of Young Deers to have survived.
