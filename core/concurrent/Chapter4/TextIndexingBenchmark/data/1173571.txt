The Warriors, from Coney Island, attend the summit and become the focus of the drama that unfolds. Cyrus proposes to the assembled crowd a permanent citywide truce that would allow the gangs to control the city. Most of the gangs laud his idea, but Luther, leader of the Rogues, shoots Cyrus dead. In the resulting chaos, Luther frames the Warriors leader Cleon for the murder, and Cleon is beaten down by the Riffs. The other Warriors escape, unaware that theyve been implicated in Cyrus murder. The Riffs put out a hit on the Warriors through a radio Disc jockey|DJ. Swan, the Warriors "war chief", takes charge of the group as they try to make it back home.

Almost immediately the Warriors are spotted by the Turnbull ACs who attempt to run them down with their bus, but the Warriors manage to escape and board the subway. On the ride to Coney Island, the train is stopped by a fire on the tracks, stranding the Warriors in Tremont, Bronx|Tremont, in the Bronx. Setting out on foot, they come across a group called the Orphans who were not invited to Cyrus meeting and who are upset about their low status in the city gang hierarchy. Swan makes peace with the Orphans leader, Sully, who agrees to let the Warriors through their territory. However, a young woman named Mercy mocks Sully as a "chicken" and instigates a confrontation, which the Warriors avoid by destroying a car using a Molotov cocktail.

 Lawrence Gordon who commissioned David Shaber to write a script. Gordon sent the script to director Walter Hill with a copy of Sol Yuricks novel. Hill recalls, "I said Larry, I would love to do this, but nobody will let us do it. It was going to be too extreme and too weird."   accessed 12 June 2014

Gordon and Hill were originally going to make a western but when the financing on the project failed to materialize, they took The Warriors to Paramount Pictures because they were interested in youth films at the time and succeeded in getting the project financed. 
 The Wanderers. As a result, Hill was unable to realize this comic book look  until the making of the Ultimate Directors Cut.

===Casting===
The filmmakers did extensive casting in New York City.  Hill had screened an independent film called Madman for Sigourney Weaver to cast her in Alien (film)|Alien and it also featured Michael Beck as the male lead. The director was impressed with Becks performance and cast him in The Warriors. Hill initially wanted a Puerto Rican actress for the role of Mercy, but Deborah Van Valkenburghs agent convinced the films casting directors to see her and she was eventually cast. The filmmakers wanted to cast Tony Danza in the role of Vermin but he was cast in the sitcom Taxi (TV series)|Taxi and Terry Michos was cast instead. While there were white characters in Yuricks book, none of the central characters or protagonists were white: according to Hill, Paramount did not want an all-black cast for "commercial reasons". 

===Shooting===
Stunt coordinator Craig R. Baxley put the cast through stunt school because Hill wanted realistic fights depicted in the film.  In preparation for his role, James Remar hung out at Coney Island to find a model for his character. The entire film was shot on the streets in New York City with some interior scenes done at Astoria Studios. They would shoot from sundown to sunrise. The film quickly fell behind schedule and went over budget. While they shot in the Bronx, bricks were tossed at the crew. Actor Joel Weiss remembers that filming of his scene at Avenue A being canceled because there was a double homicide nearby. For the big meeting at the beginning of the film, Hill wanted real gang members in the scene with off duty police officers also in the crowd so that there would be no trouble. 

The studio would not allow Baxley to bring any stunt men from Hollywood and he needed someone to double for the character of Cyrus so he did the stunt himself dressed as the character.  Actual gang members wanted to challenge some of the cast members but were dealt with by production security. The actors playing The Warriors bonded early in the shoot, on and off the set. Originally, the character of Fox was supposed to end up with Mercy, while Swan was captured by a rival, homosexual gang known as the Dingos, only to escape later: however, Hill watched the dailies and realized that Beck and Van Valkenburgh had great chemistry; the script was rewritten so that their characters ended up together.  This resulted in actor Thomas G. Waites  arguing with Hill and being difficult on the set, and so Waites was fired eight weeks into principal photography. 

The Rogues car in the Coney Island confrontation was a 1955 Cadillac hearse.  Originally, at the Coney Island confrontation at the end of the film, actor David Patrick Kelly wanted to use two dead pigeons but Hill did not think that would work.  Instead, Kelly improvised by clinking three bottles in his right hand and ad-libbing his famous line, "Waaaaariors, come out to plaaaay".  Kelly was influenced by a man he knew in downtown New York who would make fun of him. Hill wanted Orson Welles to do a narrated introduction about Greek themes but the studio did not like this idea and refused to pay for it.

The following weekend the film was linked to sporadic outbreaks of vandalism and three killings — two in Southern California and one in Boston — involving moviegoers on their way to or from showings. 

This prompted Paramount to remove advertisements from radio and television completely and display ads in the press were reduced to the films title, rating and participating theaters.  In reaction, 200 theaters across the country added security personnel. Due to safety concerns, theater owners were relieved of their contractual obligations if they did not want to show the film, and Paramount offered to pay costs for additional security and damages due to vandalism. {{Cite news

The Warriors is like visual rock".  In its sixth week, The Warriors had grossed $16.4 million, well above its estimated $4 million  to $7 million budget.  

Hill later reflected:
 What made it a success with young people... is that for the first time somebody made a film within Hollywood, big distribution, that took the gang situation and did not present it as a social problem. Presented them as a neutral or positive aspect of their lives. As soon as you said in the old days gang movies it was how do we cure the pestilence and how do we fix the social waste. We want to take these kids, make sure they go to college... This was just a movie that conceptually was different. Accepted the idea of the gang, didnt question it, that was their lives, they functioned within that context. And the social problem wasnt were they going to college, but were they going to survive. Its the great Hawksian dictum, where is the drama? Will he live or die? Thats the drama.  

===Critical reception===
The Warriors received negative reviews from contemporary critics, who derided its lack of realism and found its dialogue stilted.  In his review for the   wrote, "None of Hills dynamism will save The Warriors from impressing most neutral observers as a ghastly folly".  In his review for   magazines Frank Rich said that, "unfortunately, sheer visual zip is not enough to carry the film; it drags from one scuffle to the next ... The Warriors is not lively enough to be cheap fun or thoughtful enough to be serious".  Yurick expressed his disappointment and speculated that it scared some people because "it appeals to the fear of a demonic uprising by lumpen youth", appealing to many teenagers because it "hits a series of collective fantasies".  President Ronald Reagan was a fan of the film, even calling the films lead actor, Michael Beck, to tell him he had screened it at Camp David and enjoyed it.   

The Warriors has become a cult film, along with a re-examination of its standing with some film critics. As of February 19, 2015, the film has garnered a 94% approval rating at review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes based on 33 reviews.  At Seattles Grand Illusion Cinema, programmer Zack Carlson remembers, "people were squeezed in, lying on the floor, cheering".    Entertainment Weekly named The Warriors the 16th-greatest cult film on their "Top 50 Greatest Cult Films" list.  The magazine also ranked it 14th in the list of the "25 Most Controversial Movies Ever". 

===Home video===
