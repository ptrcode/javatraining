==Plot==
The film is set in England where an American pathologist Dr. Richard Murray is grieving for his late wife Carol who died in a car crash a few months previously. Murrays grief is accentuated by the guilt that he feels as he was having an affair with another woman prior to Carols death. As a consequence, Murray has started drinking large amounts of whiskey and is having blackouts, forgetting what has transpired in his previous drinking sessions.

Murray begins to receive messages on his computer which he believes to be clues to his wifes death. When he realises that in the same area a serial killer is attacking women he begins to suspect himself of the murders and of the murder of his wife.
