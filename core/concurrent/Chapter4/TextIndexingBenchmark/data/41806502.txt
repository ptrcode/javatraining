== Plot ==
 Nassau County going to bars, and Terry makes the decision to drive home while intoxicated, resulting in a DWI arrest. 

The first part of the film takes place from New Years Day 2012 to the beginning of Spring and the main tension revolves around the characters struggling to cope with the transition to adulthood. Terry still lives at home with his mother and now has no vehicle due to his DWI. Sal and Meghan are debating whether or not they want to start a family, Nate is unemployed, and Eric and Linas relationship is tested as Eric struggles to pay off his student loans while Lina desperately wants to leave the "change at Jamaica crowd" for the glitz and glamor of New York City. 

The film then transitions into the spring and summer where the characters attempt to situate their love lives. Sal and Meghan decide that theyre going to try and have a child, but are struggling to conceive. Nate tries to solve his relationship woes through online dating, while Eric finds a new love in Christine, a hair salon owner. Meanwhile, Terry begins courting Kelly, a classmate of his from a drunk drivers education course, while Lina moves into the Manhattan and begins working at an art gallery.

As the Summer transitions to Autumn, the male characters develop problems of their own amongst one another in the wake of the loss of a loved one. These differences are tested when Hurricane Sandy destroys Sal and Meghans Long Beach apartment and brings everyone into the same room for the films climax. 

A year passes from the films opening scene when on December 31, 2012, Terry, Lina, Nate, Eric, Sal, and Meghan make plans to go into Manhattan to visit Kelly at her new apartment for a New Years party.

== Soundtrack ==
 John Nolan of Taking Back Sunday, Vinnie Caruana of I Am the Avalanche, Happy Body Slow Brain, Bayside (band)|Bayside, and NGHBRS. 

In July 2014, John Nolans original song for the movie entitled "Here Comes the Wolf" was awarded with the "Best Original Song" honor at the Long Island International Film Expo.  The song was also nominated for the same award at the Long Beach International Film Festival and The Other Venice Film Festival in Venice, California. 

On October 21, 2014 the soundtrack was digitally released through spotify, iTunes, google play, and other online digital retailers. The digital release of the album does not include "Indiana" by Bayside or "Hold Up Girl" by NGHBRS, because those two songs had previously been released by the artists themselves.

After a soundtrack release show at Webster Hall headlined by John Nolan and Vinnie Caruana,  the soundtrack was released by Enjoy the Ride Records on December 30, 2014 with the following tracklisting:

== Score ==

The original score for "Bridge and Tunnel" was composed by Ryan Hunter, the former lead singer of Envy on the Coast.  Hunters score was engineered by his former band mate Brian Byrne, and also features guest appearances by Isaac Bolivar and Dylan Ebrahimian.  In creating the score Hunter stated, “I started watching the film a lot, picking out scenes that I wanted to make music to. I also decided upon making music for those scenes that the music might not even end up there…I knew before going into it it needed an organic and imperfect approach to it. I called Brian Byrne to help me produce it and to engineer it, his studio has a lot of cool old toys and half broken instruments to work with and that’s kind of what this called for.” 

The score was released digitally on September 16, 2014  with the following tracklisting:

{{tracklist
| total_length = 16:04
| title1 = Springs, LI
