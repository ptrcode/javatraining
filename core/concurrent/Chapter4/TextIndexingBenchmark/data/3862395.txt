Princess Aurora is a 2005 South Korean film about a mother over grieving the death of her child, who goes on a murderous revenge spree. It was the directorial and writing debut of actress-director Bang Eun-jin.   

==Plot==
A strange series of murders begin to take place in Korea. There seems to be no connection between the victims, only a small sticker depicting a character from the popular "Princess Aurora" cartoon series is found at every crime scene. 

Detective Oh Sung-ho (Moon Sung-keun), who is studying to become a priest, and his partner (Kwon Oh-joong) are working on the serial murder case, with little progress. Sung-ho begins to suspect that his ex-wife Jung Soon-jung (Uhm Jung-hwa) might be behind the murders. Uncertain of his suspicions, Sung-ho withholds information, and instead of confirming Soon-jungs guilt or innocence, gets caught up emotionally and spends a romantic night with her. The killings continue, with Soon-jung out to punish everyone whom she believes played a role in her young childs death. Soon-jung eventually allows herself to be captured, in order to complete the final act of her revenge.
