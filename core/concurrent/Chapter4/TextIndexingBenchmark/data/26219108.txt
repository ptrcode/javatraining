==Synopsis== set in secret agents to the uncivilized kingdom of Mtela. British agent John Culbertson (played by Peters) survives an attempt on his life and leads a safari from Bajuma, on the edge of the desert, to the savage kingdom.

An agent of the rival government, Madame (played by Glaum), who is known as the "Leopard Woman," is also leading a safari to Mtela. Her mission is to prevent the Englishman from reaching the kingdom. The two parties meet in the desert. The Leopard Womans men are exhausted and dehydrated and she is forced to seek Culbertsons help.

The Leopard Woman then feigns illness and manages to fulfill her promise to delay Culbertson. Although her government has given her orders to kill him, she falls in love with him. After they make love, he spurns her. She is enraged and orders her servant, Chaké (played by Johnson), to kill him. The attempt fails, however, and the Leopard Woman is relieved. She has decided that she really loves him after all.

Culbertson then loses his sight due to overexposure to the sun and his progress is delayed further. The Leopard Woman smashes his bottle of medicine in the hope of forcing him to return to Bajuma. Despite his blindness, Culbertson is determined to complete his mission and goes on to Mtela.

With the help of a record player, Culbertson forms an alliance between the primitive tribe and Britain. Choosing love over her duty as a foreign rival, the Leopard Woman sends Chaké to find the British military surgeon. When his sight is restored, Culbertson declares his love for her.

==Reviews== review of Thursday, December 9, 1920, reads:

 
"The Leopard Woman, romance of intrigue, conquest and mystery, is at the Walker Theater. Louise Glaum appears as the seductive enchantress whose wiles fall short of their mark when love destroys her aim. The photoplay was made from Stewart Edward Whites story of the African veldt, and has been given a picturesque setting. Playing opposite the star is House Peters, who gives a delineation of the American scientist-explorer whose duty is stronger than love." "Louise Glaum." Los Angeles Times. Dec. 9, 1920. p. III 17.
