}} vampire Superhero superhero action film starring Wesley Snipes and Stephen Dorff, loosely based on the Marvel Comics character Blade (comics)|Blade.  Snipes plays Blade, a Dhampir|human-vampire hybrid who protects humans from vampires.

The film was directed by  , both written by Goyer who also directed the latter.

==Plot==
The film opens with a prologue: A pregnant woman is rushed into a hospital in labor and bleeding, reaching out for something or someone unseen. The doctors have to perform a C-section on her to save the baby, but she dies.

The film then flashes forward to a wild night with a seductive woman (Traci Lords), who leads a young man to a rave club, below a slaughterhouse. He at first has fun, but he notices other people staring at him. He casually bumps into the club owner, later revealed to be Deacon Frost (Stephen Dorff), a young upstart in the vampire community. The music peaks when blood is sprayed out from the sprinklers above (a blood rain), and most of the people reveal themselves to be vampires. In the middle of the carnage, the armor-clad vampire-hunter Eric "Blade" Brooks (Wesley Snipes) arrives and expertly slaughters a number of vampires in the club, leaving Frosts right-hand man Quinn (Donal Logue) alive and horribly burned as the police arrive on the scene.

While Quinns body is being examined in the hospital, he awakens and kills the examiner by biting his neck. Blade tracks Quinn down to a hospital, but he is able to bite a resident hematologist, Dr. Karen Jenson (NBushe Wright), before escaping once again after Blade severs his arm. In an act of mercy, Blade brings the injured Karen back to his lair and introduces her to Abraham Whistler (Kris Kristofferson), his mentor and weaponsmith. Karen resolves to study vampirism and find an antidote before she becomes a vampire herself. In working to find a stable, viable cure, she soon discovers that the anticoagulant EDTA reacts explosively with the vampire infection.

Meanwhile, Frost clashes with his vampire elders of the House of Erebus. He believes that vampires should rise from the shadows and enslave humanity while the elders believe in the subversive rule of (both human and vampire) society through their influence with police, politics, finance and real estate. Moreover, because he was not born a vampire as they were, Frost is shunned for his radical views and reckless activities. Frost studies ancient vampire lore and comes to believe that he can awaken La Magra, the Blood God, to gain absolute power. Together with his minions, he kidnaps, mutilates and kills the chief vampire of the region by exposing him to the sun, and imprisons the others.

Blade combats Frosts various minions in an effort to uncover his ultimate plan. After another encounter with Quinn and Frosts lover Mercury, Whistler explains to a suspicious Karen that Blades mother, Vanessa, was attacked while pregnant and that Blade is a half-vampire hybrid with all their superhuman strengths but none of their weaknesses except the blood thirst. After witnessing Whistler give Blade a serum to counter the thirst, Karen successfully develops an antidote to cure herself of vampirism. While Blade is out on an errand, Frost and his crew manage to invade Blades lair, kidnap Karen and mortally wound Whistler. 

Blade gives the infected and horribly beaten Whistler a gun to commit suicide, then arms himself with a number of weapons and a large supply of EDTA. He storms Frosts penthouse, overrunning the bodyguards, and soon discovers Vanessa (Sanaa Lathan) -- his own mother, whom he believed long dead -- in Frosts bed. She reveals that Frost was the vampire that bit her while she was pregnant with Blade and caused him to become the Daywalker. More guards arrive and attack Blade as Frost intimates a long since sexual relationship with Vanessa and proclaims himself as creator of their "family". Thunderstruck, Blade is defeated and taken (with Karen) to the Temple of Eternal Night for Frosts blood ritual sacrifice.

The temple antechamber drains Blades blood and filters it through the ancient channels of the temple. Karen escapes the pit where Frost had put her and feeds Blade her blood, thereby restoring his strength. Frost sacrifices the elder vampires in a mystic ritual and painfully gains the power of La Magra. However, the unintended result was not the awakening of the blood God, but the culmination of the dead elders souls that fought absorption as the energies consume Frosts body. Vanessa attacks Blade forcing him to kill her. 

In the melee, Karen secures a shotgun from a guard, shoots him dead and kills Mercury with concentrated garlic spray. Blade furiously cuts through Quinn and Frosts minions before engaging Frost. Frosts new powers make him immune to Blades conventional weapons, so Blade injects him multiple times with EDTA, causing Frost to explode. As the pair leave the temple, Karen offers to cure Blade but he chooses to forgo the cure in order to continue hunting vampires and asks her to develop a better serum.

An epilogue finds Blade observing a vampire attacking his date in Russia, indicating that Blades new campaign has spread into Europe.

==Production==
===Development===
Marvel Studios had developed the film as early as 1992, when rapper/actor LL Cool J was interested in playing the lead role.  Blade was eventually set up at New Line Cinema, with David S. Goyer writing the script. According to Goyer, New Line originally wanted to do Blade as "something that was almost a spoof" before the writer convinced them otherwise.  By 1996 Wesley Snipes was attached to star. 

===Casting===
When Goyer first pitched the idea of doing a Blade film, the executives of New Line felt there were only three actors who could possible do the role: Snipes, Denzel Washington, and Laurence Fishburne, but to Goyer, Snipes was always the perfect choice for Blade. Marc Singer was the original choice for Whistler. Jet Li was offered the role of Deacon Frost but opted to do Lethal Weapon 4 instead. Bruce Payne was also considered for the role of Frost.

===Filming===
Blade was produced on a budget of $45 million    and principal photography commenced on February 5, 1997,  in large part done in Los Angeles, with some scenes being shot in Death Valley.  The effects for the film were done by Flat Earth Productions. 

===Post-production===
The first cut of the film was 140 minutes long and it had a disastrous test screening with audiences. Heavy edits and re-shoots were implemented which delayed the release date more than half a year. The most significant change was the addition of the final sword fight between Blade and Deacon Frost, which did not exist in the original cut. In the original ending, Frost turned into La Magra and became a large swirling mass of blood instead of keeping his form. This was scrapped because they couldnt get the special effects to look right. It can be seen as a special feature on the DVD.    

==Connections to the comic==
The character Blade was created in 1973 for Marvel Comics by writer Marv Wolfman and artist Gene Colan as a supporting character in the 1970s comic The Tomb of Dracula. The comic Blade used teakwood knives and was much more the everyman in his behavior and attitude. Though courageous and brave, he displayed flaws as well, such as an inability to get along with certain other supporting cast members and a hatred of vampires that bordered on fanaticism.

The character was not originally a "daywalker" but a human being immune to being turned into a vampire. Lacking the superhuman speed and strength of his undead quarry, he relied solely on his wits and skill until he was bitten by the character Morbius, the Living Vampire|Morbius. The film portrayal of Blade was updated for a 1990s audience and the comics character was subsequently modified to match. The films version of Deacon Frost also differs greatly from his comic counterpart. Although the movie retains Frosts upstart ambitions, he was a great deal younger and more updated for the 1990s.

A Marvel Anime#Blade|Blade anime series was also done by Madhouse Company in 2011. The series consists of 12 episodes.

==Release== Howard the Punisher and Captain America both had films made previously, but neither saw a theatrical release in the United States.

===Box office===
The film went to number one in both Spain and Australia for their opening weekends. With 200 theatres showing the film, Spains filmgoers earned the film $1.5 million (US) in three days, whilst Australia earned $1 million from 132 cinemas showing the film.

France made $1.9 million in five days from 241 cinemas, but the film was less successful in Hong Kong (with $182,000 from 22 cinemas) and South Africa ($159,000 from 64 cinemas). The United Kingdom was more successful, taking in $5.7 million over 10 days,  as was Brazil, making $855,000 in four days from 133 cinemas.  The film was banned from showing in Malaysia, widely considered to have the most controlling censors in Southeast Asia.
