==Reception==
Variety (magazine)|Variety gave the film a mixed review, comparing the film to the first, stating that "much like the first time, the results are as cheerfully silly as they are compulsively watchable, despite the somewhat disappointing decision to keep one of the series’ most appealing stars (Daniel Wu) sidelined on the mainland for much of the running time." and that director Johnnie To " undisputed master of the modern Hong Kong gangster drama, turns his attention to lighter fare (like this, or 2012’s sudser "Romancing in Thin Air"), it’s like watching a great baseball pitcher warming up in the bullpen: perfect form and follow-through minus any real sizzle." 

The Hollywood Reporter gave the film a negative review, stating that the "Chinese dreams of love, wealth and sex make this rom-com reboot look very much like a calculated piggy-bank stuffer."  Slant Magazine gave the film a negative review, calling it "the worst film To has made since founding his independent studio Milkyway."    Slant opined that "this sequel jumbles the stakes and loses its drive, not least because, while Shen-ren still pines for Zixin, Qihong toils away on the mainland completely divorced from the story."
