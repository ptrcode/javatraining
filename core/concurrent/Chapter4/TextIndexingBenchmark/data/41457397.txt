==Production==
Rogen and Goldberg developed the idea for The Interview in the late 2000s, joking about what would happen if a journalist was required to assassinate a world leader.  The screenplay was originally titled Kill Kim Jong Un.  They picked North Korea leader Kim Jong-il, but put the project on hold until Jong-il died and his son Kim Jong-un assumed power in 2011. Development resumed when Rogen and Goldberg realized that Jong-un is closer to their own age, which they felt would be more humorous. To write the story, co-written with Daily Show writer Dan Sterling, they researched meticulously. They aimed to make a project more relevant and satirical than their previous films while retaining toilet humor.  Rogen and Goldberg were pleased when former NBA star Dennis Rodman visited North Korea, as it reinforced their belief that the premise of their film was realistic.   
 a cyber-attack that stole company information, Rogen and Franco were reported to have been paid $8.4 million and $6.5 million, respectively. Kevin Federline was paid $5,000 for his cameo appearance in the film. 

Principal photography began in Vancouver on October 10, 2013,  and concluded on December 20, 2013.  There are hundreds of visual effects in the film; in a crowd scene at the Pyongyang airport, many in the crowd were digitally manipulated from a shot from 22 Jump Street. 

==Controversies==

===North Korean reaction===
On June 20, 2014, Kim Myong-chol, an unofficial spokesman for the North Korean government, said The Interview "shows the desperation of the US government and American society ... a film about the assassination of a foreign leader mirrors what the US has done in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria and Ukraine".    On June 25, 2014, the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA), the state-run news agency of North Korea, reported that the government promised "stern" and "merciless" retaliation if the film were released, stating that "making and releasing a film that portrays an attack on our top-level leadership is the most blatant act of terrorism and war and will absolutely not be tolerated".     The Guardian wrote that the film premise "touched a nerve inside the regime, which takes a dim view of satirical treatment of its leaders and is notoriously paranoid about perceived threats to their safety"  and that North Korea had a "long history of sabre-rattling and of issuing harsh threats that it does not act upon".   
 United Nations ambassador Ja Song-nam condemned The Interview, saying that "the production and distribution of such a film on the assassination of an incumbent head of a sovereign state should be regarded as the most undisguised sponsoring of terrorism as well as an act of war".    The Guardian remarked that his comments were "all perfect publicity for the movie".  On July 17, 2014, the KCNA wrote to U.S. President Barack Obama, asking to have the film pulled.   

In August 2014, shortly after The Interview s release was delayed to December 25, it was reported that Sony had made post-production alterations to the film to reduce its insensitivity to North Korea. These changes included modifying the designs of buttons worn by characters, originally modeled after real North Korean military buttons praising the countrys leaders, and plans to cut a portion of Kim Jong-uns death scene. 
 bootlegs and balloon drops.     The balloon drop was postponed after the North Korean government referred to the plan as a de facto "declaration of war."  

===Sony Pictures Entertainment hack===
 
 
 leaked internal To Write Love on Her Arms. The North Korean government denied involvement in the hack.      On December 8, further materials were leaked, including a demand that Sony pull "the movie of terrorism", widely interpreted as referring to The Interview.   

The leak revealed June 2014 e-mails between Sony Pictures Entertainment CEO Michael Lynton and RAND Corporation defense analyst Bruce Bennett. Bennett advised against toning down The Interview s graphic Jong-un death scene, in the hope that it would "start some real thinking in South Korea and, I believe, in the North once the DVD leaks into the North". Bennett expressed his view that "the only resolution I can see to the North Korean nuclear and other threats is for the North Korean government to eventually go away", which he felt would be likeliest to occur following an assassination of Kim. Lynton replied that a senior figure in the United States Department of State agreed. Bennett responded that the office of Robert R. King, U.S. Special Envoy for North Korean Human Rights Issues, had determined that the North Korean statements had been "typical North Korean bullying, likely without follow-up". 

In an interview with CNN, Bennett said Lynton sits on the board of trustees of the RAND Corporation, which had asked Bennett to talk to Lynton and give his opinion on the film.    Bennett felt The Interview was "coarse" and "over the top", but that "the depiction of Kim Jong-un was a picture that needed to get into North Korea. There are a lot of people in prison camps in North Korea who need to take advantage of a change of thinking in the north." Bennett felt that if the DVD were smuggled into the country it might have an effect "over time".  Bennett contacted the Special Envoy for North Korean Human Rights Issues, a personal friend of his, who "took the standard government approach: we dont tell industry what to do".  Jen Psaki, a spokesperson for the United States Department of State, confirmed that Daniel R. Russel, the U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs, had spoken to Sony executives; she reiterated that "entertainers are free to make movies of their choosing, and we are not involved in that". 

===Hackers threats=== New York premiere of The Interview and any other cinema showing it on its theatrical release, stating: 
 We will 11th of September 2001. We recommend you to keep yourself distant from the places at that time. (If your house is nearby, youd better leave.)

Whatever comes in the coming days is called by the greed of Sony Pictures Entertainment. All the world will denounce the SONY. }}On December 18, two further messages allegedly from the Guardians of Peace were released. One, sent in a private message to Sony executives, stated that the hackers would not release further information if Sony never releases the film and removed its presence from the internet. The other, posted to Pastebin, a web application used for text storage which the Guardians of Peace used for previous messages, stated that Sony had "suffered enough" and could release The Interview, but only if Kim Jong-uns death scene was not "too happy". The message also threatened that if Sony made another film antagonizing North Korea, the hackers "will be here ready to fight". {{cite news |last1=Weise |first1=Elizabeth |last2=Johnson |first2=Kevin |title=Obama: Sony "did the wrong thing" when it pulled movie

===Alleged use of unlicensed music===
On December 26, 2014, Korean hip hop|K-hiphop singer Yoon Mi-rae announced she would sue Sony Pictures for using her song "Pay Day" in the film without permission. 

==Release== premiere was held in Los Angeles on December 11, 2014.  The film scheduled a wide release in the UK and Ireland on February 6, 2015.  Netflix also announced plans to stream the movie on January 24. 

===Cancellation of wide theatrical release=== ArcLight and Carmike cinema chains announced that they would not screen the film. 
 Regal and Southern Theatres either delayed or canceled screenings of the film.    The chains reportedly came under pressure from the malls where many theaters are located, which feared that the terror threat would harm their holiday sales. They also feared expensive lawsuits in the event of an attack; Cinemark, for instance, contended that it could not have foreseen the 2012 Aurora shooting, which took place at one of its multiplexes, a defense that would not hold in the case of an attack at a screening of The Interview. 

The same day, Sony stated that "we respect and understand our partners decision and, of course, completely share their paramount interest in the safety of employees and theater-goers ... We are deeply saddened at this brazen effort to suppress the distribution of a movie, and in the process do damage to our company, our employees, and the American public. We stand by our filmmakers and their right to free expression and are extremely disappointed by this outcome."    Sony stated that it had no plans to release the film on any platform, including home video.    On January 9, 2015, Sony Entertainment CEO Michael Lynton said "We probably in retrospect should have said were exploring other options, because thats exactly what we were doing."

Sony received criticism for canceling the wide release.      Guardian film critic Peter Bradshaw wrote that it was an "unprecedented defeat on American turf", but that "North Korea will find that their bullying edict will haunt them."  In the Capital and Gizmodo suggested the cancellation caused a Streisand effect, whereby the attempt to remove or censor a work has the unintended consequence of publicizing it more widely.

In a press conference, U.S. President Barack Obama stated that though he was sympathetic to Sonys need to protect employees, he thought Sony had "made a mistake. We cannot have a society in which some dictator in some place can start imposing censorship in the United States. I wish theyd spoken to me first. I would have told them: do not get into the pattern in which you are intimidated."   

Lynton stated that cancellation was in response to the refusal of cinema chains to screen the film, not the hackers threats, and that Sony would seek other ways to distribute the film. Sony stated that the company "is and always has been strongly committed to the First Amendment ... Free expression should never be suppressed by threats and extortion." 

===Revised release===
In the days following the cancellation, the Hollywood Reporter and the New York Post reported that Sony was considering other ways to release the film, citing pressure from the film industry, theater owners, and the White House.       On NBC News|NBCs Meet the Press on December 21, Sonys legal counsel David Boies stated that the company was committed to releasing the movie.

==Reception==

===Box office and online rentals===
The Interview opened to a limited release in the United States on December 25, 2014, across 331 theaters  and earned over $1 million on its opening day. Variety (magazine)|Variety called the opening gross "an impressive launch for a title playing in only about 300 independent theaters in the U.S."  It went on to earn over $1.8 million in its opening weekend, and by January 5, 2015, had grossed $5.4 million at the box office. 

Within four days of its online release on December 24, 2014, The Interview earned over $15 million through online rentals and purchases. It became Sony Pictures highest-grossing online release, outselling Arbitrage (film)|Arbitrage ($14 million), Bachelorette (film)|Bachelorette ($8.2 million), and Snowpiercer ($7 million).    It is the top-selling Google Play and YouTube film of 2014.  By January 20, 2015, the film had earned more than $40 million from online sales and rentals. 

Sony expects The Interview to break even through video on demand sales and saving millions of dollars on marketing.  The National Association of Theater Owners contends that Sony will lose at least $30 million due to poor box office performance. 

===Critical response===
The Interview received mixed reviews from critics. On review aggregation website  , the film has a score of 52 out of 100, based on 33 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews". 

IGNs Roth Cornet wrote that "though its unlikely to stand out as one of the shrewdest political satires of its time,   is a clever, unrestrained and—most importantly—sidesplitting parody that pokes fun at both a vapid media and one of the worlds most dangerous dictators."  Edward Douglas of CraveOnline|ComingSoon.net said the film was "hilarious, but it will probably get us nuked".  Jordan Hoffman of The Guardian gave the film three out of five stars and wrote that "if this unessential but agreeable movie really triggered an international response, this is life reflecting art in a major way." 

Scott Foundas of Variety (magazine)|Variety panned the film as "cinematic waterboarding" and "about as funny as a communist food shortage, and just as protracted", but praised the performances of Randall Park and Diana Bang.  Mike Hale of The New York Times also praised Park and Bang, but wrote that "after seeing The Interview and the ruckus its mere existence has caused, the only sensible reaction is amazement at the huge disconnect between the innocuousness of the film and the viciousness of the response."
