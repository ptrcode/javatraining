 possessed by an evil spirit after communicating with it through a friends Ouija board. The film was released in December 1986 in fifteen theaters, and received a wide release in March 1987. 

==Plot==
Brandon Sinclair brings out his ouija board at a party and attempts to contact David, the spirit of a dead ten-year-old boy with whom he has communicated numerous times. The spirit responds, but Jim, formerly Brandons best friend and now nemesis, insults David, making David angry and provoking David to slash the tires of Brandons car.

The next day, Linda, Jims live-in girlfriend, sees Brandons ouija board (which Brandon left behind from the previous night) and tries to contact David. The spirit that appears is actually an evil being (Malfeitor) acting under the guise of David. This malicious spirit starts being nice and helpful, informing Linda where her lost diamond engagement ring is. Meanwhile, at the construction site where Jim is working, Jims friend Lloyd is killed by the murderous spirit. Linda again contacts Malfeitor—whom she still believes to be David—and he lies, responding that he did not cause the accident. Linda begins to fall under "progressive entrapment", in which the spirit changes and starts to terrorize the user, making the person weak and easy to possess.

Brandon brings over a psychic medium named Sarah "Zarabeth" Crawford to contact David, and if necessary, exorcise him from the building. David puts up little resistance and leaves, but after leaving, Zarabeth is suspicious and wants to research the occurrence. Not long after getting home, she is visited by Malfeitor, who slashes her throat and throws her out of the window, impaling her on a spike. The next morning Brandon is shocked to hear on the news about Zarabeths death, and immediately suspects David murdered her.

Brandon and Jim conduct research on David, and later accuse him of terrorizing Linda. They play with the Ouija board and discover that another spirit is frightening Linda. The same spirit then attacks and kills Brandon.
 possessed by the evil entity. The next morning, Jim returns and discovers the apartment in disarray, with Linda wearing mens formal wear and holding an fire axe.

Just then, Dewhurst, the detective investigating the murders he suspects were perpetrated by Jim (but were actually committed by Malfeitor), enters the apartment. He accuses Jim of hurting Linda, but quickly discovers that he is wrong as he is immediately  smacked in the face with a fire poker, rendering him unconscious and causing him to drop his gun. Jim picks up the gun and shoots the board many times right before Linda pushes him out the window.

The next scene is at the church at Jim and Lindas wedding. As a girl and the apartment landlady clean up the apartment, they both find the ouija board and the girl says, "Wonder if it still works?" The landlady then throws it into a box with the planchette. The camera then zooms to "yes" on the board as the planchette moves to it by itself.
