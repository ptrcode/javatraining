==Plot==
Chandra Shekhar aka Chandu (Nitin Kumar Reddy|Nitin) is a daredevil youth and is a fearless boy. Once he comes across a beautiful girl Nandu (Hansika Motwani), daughter of a dreaded factionalist Peddi Reddy (Suman (actor)|Suman). Soon he loses his heart. He starts teasing her and wants to prove that he is sincerely loving Nandu. He tells Nandu that he could do anything for her. Then the latter tells him that he should not follow her until she calls him. In order to grab her attention, he sends his father (Chandra Mohan (actor)|Chandramohan) and mother (Pragati) to express his love and let her know that they too encourage him instead of trying to divert his attention from love. Later Nandu realises that she too is truly loving him. At this juncture, Jayaprakash Reddy (Jayaprakash Reddy) goes to Peddi Reddy for an alliance for his brothers son Veera Pratap Reddy (Saleem Baig). Peddi Reddy refuses to marry Nandu with Veera Pratap Reddy. This flares up the factionalism between the two. At a time when Nandu wants to express her love to Chandu, she is taken away by her father to their village. The climax deals as to how the two meet and how the success of their love turns up.
