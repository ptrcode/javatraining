Eventually Paramount Studios agreed to finance the film, with Lucas negotiating a five-picture deal. By April 1980, Kasdans fifth draft was produced, and production was getting ready to shoot at Elstree Studios, with Lucas trying to keep costs down. Hearn, pp. 127-134  With four illustrators, Raiders of the Lost Ark was Spielbergs most storyboarded film of his career to date, further helping the film economically. He and Lucas agreed on a tight schedule to keep costs down and to follow the "quick and dirty" feel of the old Saturday matinée serials. Special effects were done using puppets, miniature models, animation, and camera trickery.  "We didnt do 30 or 40 takes; usually only four. It was like silent film--shoot only what you need, no waste," Spielberg said. "Had I had more time and money, it would have turned out a pretentious movie." Lucas also directed some of the second unit. {{Cite news

In the finished film, during the scene in which Indiana comes face-to-face with the cobra, a reflection in glass screen that protected Ford from the snake was seen,  an issue that was corrected in the 2003 digitally-enhanced re-release. Unlike Indiana, both Ford and Spielberg do not have a fear of snakes, but Spielberg said that seeing all the snakes on the set writhing around made him "want to puke".

For the snakes in the Well of Souls sequence, fingers running through cheese casserole and sponges sliding over cement were used for the slithering noises.

In addition to his use of such time-honored foley work, Burtt also demonstrated the modern expertise honed during his award-winning work on Star Wars.

John Williams composed the score for Raiders of the Lost Ark, which was the only score in the series performed by the London Symphony Orchestra, the same orchestra that performed the scores for the Star Wars saga. The score most notably features the well-known "Raiders March." This piece came to symbolize Indiana Jones and was later used in the scores for the other three films. Williams originally wrote two different candidates for Joness theme, but Spielberg enjoyed them so much that he insisted that both be used together in what became the "Raiders March". {{Cite video

In 2014, film director Steven Soderbergh published an experimental black-and-white version of the film, with the original soundtrack and dialogue replaced by an electronic soundtrack.   Soderbergh said his intention was to encourage viewers to focus on Spielbergs extraordinary staging and editing: "This filmmaker forgot more about staging by the time he made his first feature than I know to this day." 

Assessing the films legacy in 1997, Bernard Weinraub, film critic for The New York Times, which had initially reviewed the film as "deliriously funny, ingenious, and stylish", {{cite news

}}  maintained that "the decline in the traditional family G-rated film, for general audiences, probably began" with the appearance of Raiders of the Lost Ark. "Whether by accident or design," found Weinraub, "the filmmakers made a comic nonstop action film intended mostly for adults but also for children." {{cite news

==2012 replica mystery==
In December 2012, the University of Chicagos admissions department received a package in the mail addressed to Henry Walton Jones, Jr., Indiana Jones full name. The address on the stamped package was listed for a hall that was the former home of the universitys geology and geography department. Inside the manila envelope was a detailed replica journal similar to the one Jones used in the movie, as well as postcards and pictures of Marion Ravenwood. The admissions department posted pictures of the contents on its Internet blog, looking for any information about the package. It was discovered that the package was part of a set to be shipped from Guam to Italy that had been sold on eBay. The package with the journal had fallen out in transit and a postal worker had sent it to the university, as it had a complete address and postage, which turned out to be fake. All contents were from a Guam "prop replicator" who sells them all over the world. The university will display its replica in the main lobby of the Oriental Institute. 

==Fortress of Kuelap== Chachapoyan Warriors in the Andes of Northern Peru. The Chachapoyans, which means “People of the Clouds,” did exist and have left behind scores of ruins; most notably Kuelap “The Fortress of the Clouds.” The fortress of Kuelap remains with its long, high walls (600 meters in length, 110 meters in width, and 19 meters high) and remnants of more than four hundred buildings. Radiocarbon dating indicates the site was constructed as early as the 6th Century AD and was used throughout the pre-Columbian period. Similar to Raiders, the entryway to Kuelap is long and very narrow. Archaeologists believe the entrance was designed this way so that it could be easily defended as only one attacker could fit through the entrance at a time. Many Chachapoyan grave sites and mummies have also been located amongst the ruins of Kuelap.
