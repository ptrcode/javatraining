==Reception==
Sify wrote "For all those who are used to watching taut thrillers that leave you spellbound, 10.30 am Local Call could end up as a joke, at best. It is amateurish to the core, predictable and its making lacks any kind of imagination". 

Indiaglitz wrote "10 30 am Local call has a decent and absorbing narrative and some good performances coupled with a fine technical side, soulful BG and music as its aces". 
 
Veeyen from Nowrunning gave 2 stars and wrote "10.30 am Local Call lacks the very vital element of a thriller - that of a persuasive ground that would put in the final piece and complete the puzzle".
