==Plot==
 
Carrying out orders to execute a priest, rookie hitman Ray accidentally also kills a young boy. He and his mentor Ken are sent to Bruges by their employer Harry, where they are to await further instructions. Placidly biding his time until they can return to England, Ken finds the city charming and quaint, while Ray has nothing but contempt for it. 
 dwarf actor, which amuses Ray. Ray strikes up a romance with Chloë, a local drug dealer moonlighting as a production assistant, taking her to a fancy restaurant, where he gets involved in a fistfight with an abrasive couple. Later at her apartment, Chloës ex-boyfriend Eirik suddenly appears and brandishes a handgun loaded with Blank (cartridge)|blanks, but Ray disarms him, and blinds him in one eye by discharging the gun in his face. Chloë shamefully admits that she and Eirik occasionally rob tourists after she seduces them, insisting shed told Eirik that Ray was not a target. Ray also becomes acquainted with Jimmy, the dwarf actor, who turns out to be a drug-abusing racist.

Ken finally receives a call from Harry, unexpectedly ordering him to kill Ray, on the principle that the killing of a child—even accidentally—is unforgivable. Harry explains that he sent the pair to Bruges because he loved the city as a boy and wanted to give Ray one last beautiful memory before dying. With a handgun supplied by Harrys local contact Yuri, Ken reluctantly tracks Ray to a park and prepares to kill him. But Ray, distraught at his killing of the boy, is about to shoot himself with Eiriks loaded gun, and Ken instead stops him. Ken admits that he has been ordered to kill Ray, but convinces him to instead get on a train out of Bruges and not return to England, to make a new start elsewhere. Ken informs Harry of this, who immediately sets out for Bruges, enraged at the disobedience.

However Ray is identified on the train by the couple he assaulted in the restaurant, and is escorted back to Bruges. Chloë bails him out, and the two share a drink on the market square beneath Belfry of Bruges|Bruges belfry. Ken and Harry also meet for a drink nearby, then climb to the top of the carillon tower, where Ken argues that Ray deserves a chance at redemption, and accepts whatever fate Harry has for him in defense of that; baffled by Kens principles, Harry shoots him in the leg. Eirik then alerts Harry that Ray has returned, and Ken is mortally wounded trying to stop Harry. As Harry descends the steps to kill Ray, Ken drags himself back to the top of the tower, but fog prevents him from using his gun. Instead he dives from the tower and lands dramatically in the plaza, living just long enough to warn Ray of Harrys arrival.

Harry pursues Ray through the city, and wounds him with a single shot from a distance. Ray staggers onto the street where the film is shooting, as Harry catches up. He shoots Ray repeatedly, also hitting Jimmy, who is costumed as a schoolboy. Believing he has killed a child (in the same way Ray had), Harry kills himself. Gravely wounded, Ray is lifted into an ambulance, as he muses over his fate: hoping to live to present himself to the parents of the boy he killed, for judgment. And hoping above all else not to spend eternity in Bruges.

== Cultural references ==
The plot has similarities to Harold Pinters one-act play The Dumb Waiter.  When checking into the hotel, Ray and Ken use the names Cranham and Blakely, a reference to Kenneth Cranham and Colin Blakely who played the hitmen in the BBC version of Pinters play.
The film also contains many references to Dont Look Now,  including the claim by Chloë that the film-within-a-film is almost an homage to it.

Likewise, the scene where Ken is instructed to kill Ray was shot in a single, unbroken take, in a nod to the 3-minute single-take opening of Orson Welles Touch of Evil, which can be seen playing on a TV in the background.

  gave the film three-and-a-half stars out of four and praised the two leads, stating that "Brendan Gleeson is brilliant as Ken ... along with his partner in crime, Ray, played by Colin Farrell in probably his best performance." About the film, she added that its "sharply written, superbly acted, funny and even occasionally touching."    Damon Wise of Empire (magazine)|Empire magazine gave the film four out of five stars, writing that "with In Bruges, the British gangster movie gets a Croydon facelift. It may not be new, but its a wonderfully fresh take on a familiar genre: fucked-up, far-out and very, very funny."   

John Anderson of the   movies." She continued about the film: "A jolly mess of a movie. Overplotted, choppy, and contrived, it nonetheless has a curious vitality that makes you wonder where McDonagh will go next."    James Berardinelli of ReelViews gave the film two-and-a-half stars out of four, writing that "the acting is top-notch. Colin Farrell, who seems to be gravitating increasingly toward smaller films, effectively channels his manic energy. He and Brendan Gleeson display chemistry in the Odd Couple vein, occasionally giving rise to instances of humor. Ralph Fiennes plays one of the most twisted roles of his career."   

Lisa Schwarzbaum of Entertainment Weekly gave the film a "C+", indicating a mixed review; she praised McDonaghs directing, stating that "hes a specialist in constructing satisfying, live-wire dramas of violence that crash up against despair, in upending his characters miseries with moments of twisted humor, and in sustaining a writing voice that roars with a particularly Irish robustness of obscenity." She also added that "neither star is sloppy, but both are loose and mellow – a couple of pros who know theyre the whole show."    Ella Taylor of Village Voice also gave the film a mixed review, stating that "Bruges may be the movies rather too-long-running joke, but Farrells shaggy brow is easily the most entertaining thing in Irish playwright Martin McDonaghs first foray into the crime caper."   

Seth Meyers is a known fan of the film, and has mentioned it multiple times on his show Late Night with Seth Meyers.
