Hog Wild is a 1930 sound film starring Laurel and Hardy and directed by James Parrott.

==Plot==
Ollie wants to join Stan for an afternoon of fun, but his wife has other ideas. She demands he install the radio antenna atop their roof, a job he has been neglecting for several weeks. Soon, Stan stops by to "help" his friend. After destroying the Hardys chimney and falling from the roof several times, they perch a ladder in the back seat of Stans car. The car shifts into gear, and speeds uncontrollably through city with Ollie still atop the ladder.

Mrs. Hardy catches up to them on foot after the car is finally stopped, Hardy having been tossed into the street with the ladder. The three attempt to return home while Laurel tries all kinds of noisy things to get the car restarted, including blowing the horn twice. A trolley car approaches them at high speed and two women and a policeman cover their eyes as a loud crash is heard. The result is the car is squashed between two trolleys and they have to drive home in the mangled car.

==Production notes==
Like other Laurel and Hardy films of this period, Hog Wild was refilmed in both Spanish and French versions in which Laurel and Hardy spoke phonetically the respective languages. The French version was titled Pele Mele; the Spanish version Radio Mania. In the UK, the film was retitled Aerial Antics, as Hog Wild was an American idiomatic expression.  The film is the first to feature a music score throughout the film. The scoring is experimental and one of the first to use pieces written by Leroy Shield. The Our Gang series was also beginning to use background music but opted to use orchestral scorings initially and began mixing several Shield tunes on the last episode of the 1929-30 season, A Tough Winter.

The short was computer-colorized in 1986.
