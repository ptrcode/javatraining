== Plot ==
The two small islands, Hvenø and Birkø, have been in a decade-long conflict, and it therefore creates big problems when three young men from one island falls in love with three beautiful, young girls from the neighbouring island. Nothing could be more unlikely than a marriage between the islands - let alone three! But one day oil is found on the first island - causing a veritable invasion of the US oil company, American Super Oil Company. And then the whole little sleepy community is turned completely upside down ...
