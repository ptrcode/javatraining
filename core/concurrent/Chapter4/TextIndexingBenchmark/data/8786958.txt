==Reception==
  USA home video release, finding the film to be an "unusually vivid and accomplished low-budget horror film". Noting that the film was conceived as a sequel to Bohus The Deadly Spawn, they remark how the sequel has nothing to do with the previous, and that the film made a "quantum leap" in visual effects. By limiting cast and location costs, production was able to concentrate efforts on effects, and that the monsters and stop-motion remain convincing and scary throughout the film.  They praised how director Takajian sustained the suspense and tension throughout the film, pacing the progress so everything comes to a head in the final reels for maximum effect.  They also note that the effects overcome earlier weak acting, and the growing intensity of the story and the more confident acting as the film progresses allow one to "forget the shakiness of what has preceded it".   In agreement, Cavett Binion of All Movie Guide felt that the film made excellent use of a limited budget. Noting that the film was intense, well-written and sported some spectacular monster effects. 

==Release==
  German VHS premiere on November 5, 1990.  The USA home video premiere was December 15, 1993. In 2003, Lions Gate Home Entertainment released the film onto DVD.
