 DreamWorks Pictures. It features the voices of Woody Allen, Sharon Stone, Jennifer Lopez, Sylvester Stallone, Dan Aykroyd, Anne Bancroft, Gene Hackman, Christopher Walken, and Danny Glover as various members of an ant society. Some of the main characters share facial similarities with the actors who voice them.  Antz is the first animated film, as well as the first CGI-animated film, by DreamWorks Animation and the second feature-length computer animation|computer-animated film after Walt Disney Pictures|Disney·Pixars Toy Story.

The film was result of a controversial public feud during the production, between DreamWorks Animation CEO Jeffrey Katzenberg and Steve Jobs and John Lasseter of Pixar, concerning the parallel productions of this film and Pixars A Bugs Life. This only worsened when Disney refused to avoid competition with DreamWorks intended first animated release, The Prince of Egypt. The film premiered on September 19, 1998, at the Toronto International Film Festival,    and was released theatrically in the United States on October 2, 1998. The film received generally positive reviews from critics, and performed modestly at the box office.

==Plot== neurotic and pessimistic worker ant living in a wholly totalitarian society who longs for the opportunity to truly express himself. His friends include fellow worker Azteca (Jennifer Lopez) and a soldier ant, Weaver (Sylvester Stallone). Z meets Princess Bala (Sharon Stone) at a bar where she goes to escape from her suffocating royal life and falls in love with her.

To see Bala again, Z exchanges places with Weaver and joins the army. He marches with the ranks, befriending a staff sergeant named Barbatus (Danny Glover) in the process. He does not realize that the armys leader and Balas fiancé, General Mandible (Gene Hackman), is secretly sending all the soldiers loyal to the Queen to die so he can begin to build a colony filled with powerful ants. At the base of a tree near nightfall, Z realizes he is actually marching into battle, and all of the soldiers except for Z are killed by acid-shooting termites. Following the battle, all Z can find of Barbatus is his head. Before he dies, Barbatus tells Z to think for himself rather than follow orders all his life, leaving Z saddened and depressed. Z returns home and is hailed as a war hero, even though he did not do anything and was traumatized by the fighting. He is also congratulated by the secretly irate General Mandible, and is brought before the Queen. There he meets Bala, who eventually recognizes him as a worker. When Z finds that he has been cornered, he panics and pretends to take Bala "hostage" to trick the queens guards into letting him leave rather than imprison him. They escape the colony and hide, and Z begins searching for the legendary Insectopia.

Word of the incident quickly spreads through the colony, and Zs act of individuality sparks a revolution in the workers and a few soldier ants as well, grinding productivity to a halt. Seeing an opportunity to gain control, General Mandible publicly portrays Z as a war criminal who cares only about himself. Mandible then promotes the glory of conformity and promises them a better life, which he claims to be the reward of completing a "Mega Tunnel" planned by himself. Mandible learns Z is looking for Insectopia after interrogating Weaver. Knowing of the places existence, Mandible sends his second-in-command, Colonel Cutter (Christopher Walken), to retrieve the Princess and possibly kill Z. Cutter, however, slowly begins to have second thoughts about Mandibles plans and develops sympathy for the worker ants.

Z and Bala, after a misdirection and a brief separation, finally find Insectopia, which consists of a human waste-bin overfilled with decaying food. Bala begins to reciprocate Zs feelings. However, Cutter arrives and flies Bala back to the colony against her will. Z finds them gone and makes his way to rescue Bala, aided by a wasp named Chip (Dan Aykroyd), whom he met earlier and has made himself drunk grieving over the loss of his swatted wife, Muffy (Jane Curtin). Z arrives at the colony, where he finds that Bala is being held captive in General Mandibles office. After rescuing her, he learns that General Mandibles "Mega Tunnel" leads straight to a body of water (the puddle next to Insectopia), which Mandible will use to drown the queen and the workers who have gathered at the opening ceremony. Bala goes to warn the workers and her mother at the ceremony, while Z goes to the tunnel exit to stop the workers from digging any further. He fails, however, and the water leaks in. Z and Bala unify the workers into a single working unit and build a towering ladder of ants towards the surface as the water continues to rise.

Meanwhile, General Mandible and his soldiers are gathered at the surface, where he explains to them his vision of a new colony with none of the "weak elements of the colony". He is interrupted, however, when the workers successfully claw their way to the surface and break through. Mandible angrily tries to kill Z but is stopped by Cutter, who finally rebels against Mandible and instead tries to help Z and the worker ants out of the hole "for the good of the colony." The enraged Mandible charges toward Cutter, but Z pushes Cutter out of the way at the last minute and is tackled into the flooded colony with Mandible. Mandible is killed when he lands upon a root while Z falls into the water. Cutter, taking charge, orders the other soldier ants to help the workers and the queen onto the surface while he himself rescues Z. Although it seems that Z is dead, Bala successfully resuscitates him. Z is lauded for his heroism and marries Bala. Together they rebuild the colony, transforming the colony from a conformist military state into a community that values each and every one of its members.

===Feud between DreamWorks and Pixar===
After DreamWorks acquisition of PDI, Pixar director  " for computer-animation companies, he told various friends.  "I should have been wary," Lasseter later recalled. "Jeffrey kept asking questions about when it would be released." 
 Tim Johnson that was related to Katzenberg in October 1994.  Another source gives Nina Jacobson, one of Katzenbergs executives, as the person responsible for Antz pitch.  Lasseter would not believe Katzenbergs story and called "bullshit".    Lasseter recalled that Katzenberg began explaining that Disney was "out to get him" and that he realized that he was just cannon fodder in Katzenbergs fight with Disney.   Eisner had decided not to pay Katzenberg his contract-required bonus, convincing Disneys board not to give him anything.  Lasseter grimly relayed the news of Antz to Pixar employees but kept morale high. Privately, Lasseter told other executives that he and Stanton felt terribly let down. 

===Competition with Disney===
At the time, the current Disney studio executives were starting a bitter competitive rivalry with Jeffrey Katzenberg and his new DreamWorks films. In 1995, Katzenberg announced The Prince of Egypt to debut in November 1998 as DreamWorks first animated release.  A year later, Disney scheduled Bugs to open on the same week, which infuriated Katzenberg. Katzenberg invited Disney executives to DreamWorks to negotiate a release date change for Bugs, to which Disney kept the date unchanged. DreamWorks pushed Prince of Egypt to the Christmas season and the studio planned to not begin full marketing for Antz before their planned first film.  Disney afterward announced release dates for films that were going to compete with Egypt. Katzenberg suddenly moved the opening of Antz from March 1999 to October 1998 to compete with Pixars release.       
 extortion attempt".

===Release fallout and comparisons===
As the release dates for both films approached, Disney executives concluded that Pixar should keep quiet on Antz and the feud concerning DreamWorks. Regardless, Lasseter publicly dismissed Antz as a "schlock version" of A Bugs Life. Price, p. 173  Lasseter, who claimed to have never seen Antz, told others that if DreamWorks and PDI had made the film about anything other than insects, he would have closed Pixar for the day so the entire company could go see it.  Price, p. 174  Jobs and Katzenberg would not back down and the rivaling ant films provoked a press frenzy. "The bad guys rarely win," Jobs told the Los Angeles Times. In response, DreamWorks’ head of marketing Terry Press suggested, "Steve Jobs should take a pill."  Tensions would remain high between Jobs and Katzenberg for many years after the release of both films. According to Jobs, years later Katzenberg came to him after the opening of Shrek. He insisted that he had never heard the pitch for A Bugs Life, reasoning that his settlement with Disney would have given him a share of the profits if that were so.    In the end, Pixar and PDI employees kept up the old friendships that had arisen from working in computer animation for years before feature films. 

The final product of both films are generally perceived to contrast one another in tone and certain plot points. Antz in the end seemed to be more geared towards teenagers and adults, featuring moderate violence and death, mild sexual humor, as well as social and political satire. A Bugs Life was more family-friendly and lighthearted in tone and story. In design they too share noticeable differences, Antz played off real aspects of ants and how they relate to other bugs, like termites and bees, while Bugs Life offered a more fanciful look at insects to better suit its story. PopMatters journalist J.C. Maçek III compared the two films and wrote, "The feud deepened with both teams making accusations and excuses and a release date war ensued. While Antz beat A Bugs Life to the big screen by two months, the latter film significantly out grossed its predecessor. Rip off or not, Antzs critical response has proven to be almost exactly as positive as what A Bugs Life has enjoyed."   

==Release==
In late 1997, a teaser trailer for Antz, depicting the opening scene with Z in an ant psychiatrist office, first played in theaters in front of select prints of As Good as It Gets.  Anticipation was generally high with adult moviegoers rather than families and children.

Antz was released to DVD and VHS on March 23, 1999, becoming the first CGI animated film to be available on DVD. However, the DVD release used a 35mm print of the film to create the copies, rather than using the original files to encode the movie directly to video. 

===Critical reception=== How to Train Your Dragon received a 98% rating in 2010. Metacritic gave the film an average score of 72/100 based on 26 reviews.
Roger Ebert praised the film, saying that it is "sharp and funny". The variety of themes, interesting visuals, and voice acting were each aspects of the film that were praised.  Rogers partner, Gene Siskel, greatly enjoyed the film and preferred it over Pixars Bugs Life.   Gene later ranked it No. 6 on his picks of the Best Films of 1998. 

===Box office===
The film topped the box office in its opening weekend, earning $17,195,160 for a $7,021 average from 2,449 theatres.     In its second weekend, the film held the top spot again, with a slippage of only 14% to $14.7 million for a $5,230 average and expanding to 2,813 sites. It held well also in its third weekend, slipping only 24% to $11.2 million and finishing in third place, for a $3,863 average from 2,903 theatres. The films widest release was 2,929 theatres, and closed on February 18, 1999. The film altogether picked up $90,757,863 domestically, almost recouping its $105 million budget,    but failed to outgross the competition with A Bugs Life. The film picked up an additional $81 million overseas for a worldwide total of $171.8 million, making it a box office success.
