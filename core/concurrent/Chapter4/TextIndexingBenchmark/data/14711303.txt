==Plot==
The characters from the first film now have children, who have managed to get into the same situation as their parents many years ago. However, this story is not simply a remake of the original movie. Firstly, all of Lukashins adventures were accidental, whereas here everything is done according to a plan thought up by Pavlik (a friend of Lukashins). His idea is to help his friend Evgeniy with his loneliness. To this end, he dispatches Lukashins son Kostya to Petersburg, where he acts in the same manner as his father 30 years ago. In flat 12 he meets Nadejda (who is actually the daughter of Nadejda from the first movie). She has a fianc√© called Irakliy, a businessman. Kostantins task is to lure Iracliy away from the flat, then wait for Nadejdas mother to come; he then makes her call Evgeniy Lukashin. Pavlik persuades Evgeniy to go to St. Petersburg. The plot becomes a story of two fights over a woman: Konstantin vs. Irakliy and Evgeniy vs. Ippolit. Finally Lukashins win the competition, because Irakliy turns out to be too dull for Nadya and Nadejda understands that she was never in love with Ippolit.
