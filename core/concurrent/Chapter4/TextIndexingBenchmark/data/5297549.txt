==Plot== Soul Society. Soul Reaper) Kon (a mod soul inside Ichigos body), then confront her, but she refuses to answer any questions and leaves. In the midst of said battle, Kon stumbles upon a shadowy figure equip with dark armor, standing amongst the spirits. Ichigo follows Senna, while Rukia returns to the Soul Society in search of answers.

While pursuing Senna, Ichigo meets Tōshirō Hitsugaya and Rangiku Matsumoto, whom they are on Earth to investigate the mysterious reflections of the human world that appears in the Soul Society. At the Urahara Shop, Kisuke Urahara explains that a dimension between the Soul Society and the real world are colliding with the Valley of Screams that expands to the point that it connects. The spirits seen earlier are "Blanks", the group of amnesiac souls that were lost in the space between the two worlds and that comprise the Valley of Screams. Their memories combine to form a single entity, the "Shinenju." Deducing through the use of Kon having witnessed the armoured figure from before, he instructs the Soul Reapers assembled to find it before the mysterious group. Ichigo sees Senna around, where they make a scene at a nearby mall. At the cemetery, Senna is attacked by the mysterious group and Ichigo fends them off, without their motives.
 Gotei 13, Soi Fon, Tōshirō, Rangiku, Rukia and some armed forces declares that Senna is the real Shinenju and orders Ichigo to hand her over, but Ichigo refuses, valuing her as a being. The mysterious group calling themselves the "Dark Ones", identified group of exiles from the Soul Society seeking revenge for the past, arrives and captures Senna, while fighting off the Soul Reapers and Ichigo who is mortally wounded, but Orihime Inoue heals him back at the Urahara Shop. The Dark Ones take Senna to the Valley of Screams and attach her to a device powered by the Blanks that can cause the Valley to collapse, resulting in a collision between the real world and the Soul Society that would destroy both. 
 Izuru Kira, Ikkaku Madarame Yumichika Ayasegawa. In the meantime, Jūshirō convinces Yamamoto to prolong the destruction of the Valley so that the Soul Reaper force in there may complete the mission and escape the Valley beforehand. The Soul Reapers quickly defeat the Dark Ones and Blanks, while Ichigo defeats their leader, Ganryu. The Soul Reaper force then quickly leave the portal of the Valley and return to the real world, content in finishing the mission.

However, the process of the collapse continues, before Senna sacrifices herself to push the two worlds back apart to save Ichigo, using the power of the blanks to trigger explosions between the Real World and the Soul Society in order to stabilize both. Afterwards, when both worlds have been saved, Senna, weakened by her efforts asks Ichigo to take her to the graveyard so she can see her name on her gravestone, which had it one of a Blank whose memory Senna had, Ichigo lies and tells her that her name is on it. Believing him, she expresses contentment that she once had her own life before fading away. Rukia notes that once the power of the Blanks fades away, so will all memories of Senna. After the credits, Ichigo walking on the bridge, sees a red ribbon that he bought for Senna, floating down from the sky and sees a girl who resembles her running past him. He smiles and keeps their memory to himself.

==Reception==
Bradley Meek of T.H.E.M. Anime Reviews had expected to dislike the film, and found himself pleasantly surprised that he enjoyed the film. He felt that the film was made purely to please fans, and that those fans would be pleased. He criticized the opening sequence and some other scenes as excessively confusing and incoherent, but praises the character Senna as "a sweet character who is likeable from pretty much frame one."    Anime News Networks Carl Kimlinger agreed that the film was primarily for series fan and would be confusing to newcomers to the franchise. While he felt the film followed the basic formula for "theatrical adaptations of long-running shounen series" and attempts to cram a lot in a short time, he also felt it was "unfailingly entertaining throughout."    Fellow ANN reviewer Carlo Santos described it as "an extended filler episode" with the addition of new "disposable characters", however it notes that with a theatrical production budget the film is "a jaw-dropping, fist-pumping Best Of compilation of all the shikai, bankai, and fighting styles that make the series so dynamic". He had mixed feelings about the films soundtrack, noting that most was lifted from the series while praising the few new musical pieces as being "well-written" and well used.    
 KPBS praised the films artistry and the complex mix of themes and idealisms presented in the story. In particular, she found the films concept of "Blanks" conveyed "a deep spiritual sadness that provides unexpected depth to this supernatural action thriller."    Chris Beveridge of Mania.com felt the film met his expectations with its "high production values, a solid if predictable script and some really neat designs", yet noted that its weakness was its lack of relevance to the series and offers no permanent character growth.
