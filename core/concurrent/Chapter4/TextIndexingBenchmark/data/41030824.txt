1969. In a Vienna bookshop the Argentine chemist Rafaelo Aranda is poisoned by the bookseller Valerie Steinfeld. The bookseller commits suicide immediately afterwards. It seems the bookseller has never met him before. The chemists son, Manuel Aranda, wants to find out the background of this murder. He finds out that his father has developed chemical weapons of mass destruction and offered to sell them to the United States, the Soviet Union and France. The Secret Services of these countries try to prevent Aranda from publishing these facts. Aranda survives a first sniper attack without even noticing it.
 Nazi Party. Slowly the suspicion arises that Steinfeld and Rafaelo Aranda might have had to do with each other at this time.

With the help of Irene Waldegg, the niece of Valerie Steinfeld, Manuel Aranda finds out about the Nazi past of his father. But Valerie Steinfeld also had her personal secret. Not even Irene Waldegg had known that she also was a part of Valerie Steinfelds past.
