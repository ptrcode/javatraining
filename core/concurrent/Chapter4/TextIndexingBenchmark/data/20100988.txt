==Reception==
In comparing the film with the stageplay, Peter Travers of Rolling Stone wrote, "Nothing can compare with seeing a show conceived for the stage in an actual performance. But the cinecast of Rent, staged directed by the originals Michael Grief and for the camera by Michael Warren, comes close. Its electrifying. Jon Kamen and the wizards at radical.media have utilized state-of-the-art high-definition video and digital audio technology to make the show come alive. Thanks to the gifted cinematographer Declan Quinn (Leaving Las Vegas, Monsoon Wedding), it practically jumps off the screen... ...For the first time ever, audiences across the country who couldnt see Rent and watch members of the original cast join the new cast onstage for the final curtain reprise of Seasons of Love, can share the experience".   Of the film itself, Broadway World wrote, "the film is a dynamic way to bring the show to audiences across the country one last time"
