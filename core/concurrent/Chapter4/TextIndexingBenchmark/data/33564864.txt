Encounter with the Unknown is a 1973 American film directed by Harry Thomason.

==Plot summary==

The film presents three allegedly true stories of the supernatural. In the first tale, a witch places a lethal curse on the three young men who were inadvertently responsible for her sons death. In the second, a boys dog disappears in the vicinity of a hole in the ground from which frightening sounds have been emanating; the boys father agrees to be lowered into the hole to see if he can recover the dog, and to find out whats making the noise. The final story involves a strange, disoriented girl and the married couple who attempt to give her a ride home. According to the opening narration, the stories are based on research conducted by Dr. Jonathan Rankin, a parapsychologist, but this is evidently a fictional device as no record of the name "Jonathan Rankin" exists in parapsychological studies.  The third tale, in fact, is simply a version of the Vanishing hitchhiker, a popular urban legend. The stories themselves are narrated by Rod Serling, but the opening and closing portions of the film feature a second, uncredited narrator.     
The film was shot in Little Rock, Arkansas, at locations which include the Capital Hotel and Mount Holly Cemetery.
