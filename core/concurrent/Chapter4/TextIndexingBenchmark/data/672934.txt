 science fiction action horror short story of the same title, but aside from a single scene, the stories are unrelated. The film stars Jeff Fahey as Jobe Smith, a simple-minded gardener, and Pierce Brosnan as Dr. Lawrence Angelo, the scientist who decides to experiment on him.

The film was originally titled Stephen Kings The Lawnmower Man, but King successfully sued the producers for attaching his name to the film and stated in court documents that the film "bore no meaningful resemblance" to his story.  An earlier short film, also titled "The Lawnmower Man", is a more faithful adaptation of the short story. It was directed by Jim Gonis in 1987. 

After the success of The Lawnmower Man, Leonard would later make another virtual reality film called Virtuosity starring Academy Award winners Denzel Washington and Russell Crowe in 1995.

==Plot==
Dr. Lawrence Angelo works for Virtual Space Industries, running experiments in increasing the intelligence of chimpanzees using drugs and virtual reality. One of the chimps escapes using the warfare tactics he was being trained for.  Dr. Angelo is generally a pacifism|pacifist, who would rather explore the intelligence-enhancing potential of his research without applying it for military purposes.

Jobe Smith, a local greenskeeper with an intellectual disability, lives in the garden shed owned by the local priest, Father Francis McKeen. McKeens brother, Terry, is a local landscape gardener and employs Jobe to help him with odd jobs. Father McKeen punishes the challenged Jobe with a belt whenever he fails to complete his chores.

Dr. Angelo realizes he needs a human subject to work with, and he spots Jobe mowing his lawn.  Peter Parkette, Dr. Angelos young  neighbor, is friends with Jobe. Dr. Angelo invites both of them over to play some virtual reality games. Learning more about Jobe, Angelo persuades him to participate in his experiments, letting him know it will make him smarter. Jobe agrees and begins the program. Dr. Angelo makes it a point to redesign all the intelligence-boosting treatments without the "aggression factors" used in the chimpanzee experiments.
 The Shop, keeps tabs on the progress of the experiment, and discreetly swaps Dr. Angelos new medications with the old Project 5 supply (reintroducing the "aggression factors" into the treatment).
 telekinetic and pyrokinetic powers and takes Marnie to the lab to make love to her while in virtual reality. Something goes wrong in the simulation when Jobes virtual avatar becomes violent, attacking her mind directly; Marnie is driven insane, laughing endlessly at nothing.
 catatonic state by a mental "lawnmower man" continually mowing his brain, and a lawnmower invention of Jobes runs down Harold, Peters abusive father. Jobe uses his telepathic abilities to make the investigating police attribute it all to "bizarre accidents" in front of Dr. Angelo.

Jobe believes his final stage of evolution is to become "pure energy" in the VSI computer Mainframe computer|mainframe, and from there reach into all the systems of the world. He promises his "birth" will be signaled by every telephone on the planet ringing simultaneously. The Shop sends a team to capture Jobe, but they are ineffective against his abilities and he scatters their molecules. Jobe uses the lab equipment to enter the mainframe computer, abandoning his body to become a wholly virtual being, leaving his body behind like a husk.
 crucifies him, back door before the building is destroyed in multiple explosions.

Back at home with Peter, Dr. Angelo and Peters mother Carla (who has become a romantic interest) are about to leave when their telephone rings, followed by the noise of a second, and then hundreds of telephones ring, all around the globe.

==Production==
The plot of Stephen Kings 1975 short story "The Lawnmower Man" concerns Harold Parkette, who hires "Pastoral Greenery and Outdoor Services Inc." to cut his lawn. The serviceman who arrives to do the job has a lawnmower that mows the lawn by itself while he crawls, naked, behind the mower, eating the grass. The serviceman himself is actually a satyr who worships the Greek god Pan (mythology)|Pan. When Parkette tries to call the police, the mower and its owner ritually kill him as a sacrifice to Pan.

The films original script, written by director Brett Leonard and producer Gimel Everett, was titled Cyber God and had nothing to do with Kings short story. New Line Cinema held the film rights to Kings story, and decided to combine Cyber God with some minor elements of Kings "The Lawnmower Man". The resulting film, originally titled Stephen Kings The Lawnmower Man, differed so much from the source material that King sued the filmmakers to remove his name from the title.
 Fuji Creatives Masao Takiyama is also credited as a co-producer.

References to the short story include the scene where Jobe kills Peters father with the lawnmower "Big Red", the aftermath in which the police state that they found some of his remains in the birdbath, and the name of Terry McKeens company, Pastoral Greenery.

The film has several elements in common with the 1959 Daniel Keyes novel Flowers for Algernon, which also deals with a mentally disabled man whose intelligence is technologically boosted to genius levels. {{cite web

The computer-generated imagery (CGI) was created for the film by Angel Studios,  who later became Rockstar San Diego, and Xaos Inc. The supervising sound editor was Frank Serafine, who was hired as a result of his sound creation work in the 1982 film Tron.

Some of the computer-generated scenes were used in Beyond the Minds Eye, a video in the Minds Eye (series)|Minds Eye series.

==Reception==
The film garnered mostly mixed reviews from critics. It currently holds a 38% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 34 reviews with the consensus: "The Lawnmower Man suffers from a predictable, melodramatic script, and its once-groundbreaking visual effects look dated today".

===Box office===
The movie debuted at #2 at the box office with $7.7 million in its opening weekend behind Waynes World (film)|Waynes World.   It went on to gross $32.1 million domestically, making it a moderate financial success against its $10 million budget.

==Sequel and other media==
A sequel   was released in 1996. It was retitled Lawnmower Man 2: Jobes War for its video release. The film received negative reviews from critics and fans of the first movie.

Comic book writer Grant Morrison said in an interview  that he was contacted by the owners of the Lawnmower Man franchise in 1995 and asked to write treatments for Lawnmower Man 2 and Lawnmower Man 3. Morrison claims he was asked to "bend the Lawnmower Man series in an X-Men superhero-type direction." Neither of Morrisons script treatments were used and Lawnmower Man 2: Beyond Cyberspace was produced without his involvement.

Almost all of the CG footage of The Lawnmower Man were featured in Beyond the Minds Eye.

==Home media==
The theatrical version of the film was initially released on VHS and Laserdisc in 1992, with an unrated directors cut on VHS and Laserdisc shortly afterwards. It was the success of the unrated version that alerted King to New Lines continued defiance of the order that his name be stricken from the films credits and all marketing for it. It would take a third court order to force the studios compliance. As before, the court upheld the two prior judgments, but it took the extra step of imposing a penalty of $10,000 directly payable to King for every day New Line remained in contempt by defying the order. Additionally, the studio would have to forfeit all profits earned on the film during that same period.

The DVD, released in December 1997, contains only the theatrical cut, with scenes from the unrated edition, being presented on the DVD as merely deleted scenes.

The directors cut was released on DVD on October 25, 2010 in the United Kingdom. 

As of 2014, Blu-ray versions of the film are still only available in Italy through Minerva Pictures  and in Germany under the Alive brand.  The Italian release contains edited Italian credits at the beginning, which are taken from the DVD version as you can clearly see the difference in quality with the rest of the movie (interlaced framing notably).
