 Universal Pictures, East Coast setting of the comics to differentiate the film from numerous superhero films set in New York City-esque environments. During filming, the actors were free to create their own dialogue because pre-production was focused on the story and action. Rubber and metal versions of the armors, created by Stan Winstons company, were mixed with computer-generated imagery to create the title character.

Potts and several S.H.I.E.L.D. agents attempt to arrest Stane, but he dons his suit and attacks them. Stark fights Stane, but is outmatched without his new reactor to run his suit at full capacity. Stark lures Stane atop the Stark Industries building and instructs Potts to overload the large arc reactor there.

==Cast==
 ]] Tony Stark / Iron Man:
:An industrialist, genius inventor, and consummate playboy, he is CEO of Stark Industries and a chief weapons manufacturer for the U.S. military. Favreau had planned to cast a newcomer in the role,  but ultimately chose Downey, a fan of the comic,  because he felt the actors past made him an appropriate choice for the part, explaining that "The best and worst moments of Roberts life have been in the public eye. He had to find an inner balance to overcome obstacles that went far beyond his career. Thats Tony Stark. Robert brings a depth that goes beyond a comic book character who is having trouble in high school, or cant get the girl."  Favreau felt Downey could make Stark a "likable asshole," but also depict an authentic emotional journey once he won over the audience.  Downey had an office next to Favreau during pre-production, which allowed him greater involvement in the screenwriting process.  He brought a deeper sense of humor to the film not present in previous drafts of the script.  Downey explained, "What I usually hate about these   movies   when suddenly the guy that you were digging turns into Dudley Do-Right, and then youre supposed to buy into all his Lets go do some good! That Eliot Ness-in-a-cape-type thing. What was really important to me was to not have him change so much that hes unrecognizable. When someone used to be a schmuck and theyre not anymore, hopefully they still have a sense of humor."  To prepare, Downey spent five days a week weight training and practiced martial arts to get into shape,  which he said benefited him because "its hard not to have a personality meltdown   after about several hours in that suit. Im calling up every therapeutic moment I can think of to just get through the day."

 Obadiah Stane: googled the Book of Obadiah, and was surprised to learn retribution is a major theme in that particular book of the Bible, something which Stane represents.  Many of Stanes scenes were cut out to focus more on Stark, but the writers felt Bridgess performance allowed the application of "less is more". 

* Shaun Toub as Ho Yinsen|Yinsen:
:Starks fellow captive, who grafts an electromagnet to Starks chest "to keep the shrapnel shell shards that wounded him from reaching his heart and killing him", and who helps Stark build the first Iron Man suit.  

* Gwyneth Paltrow as Pepper Potts:
:Starks personal assistant and budding love interest. Paltrow asked Marvel to send her any comics that they would consider relevant to her understanding of the character, who she considered to be very smart, levelheaded, and grounded. She said she liked "the fact that theres a sexuality thats not blatant." Favreau wanted Potts and Starks relationship to be reminiscent of a 1940s comedy, something which Paltrow considered to be fun in a sexy, yet innocent way. 

Additionally,   as himself, being mistaken for Hugh Hefner by Stark at a party;  director Jon Favreau as Happy Hogan, Starks bodyguard and chauffeur;  Tom Morello, who also provides additional guitar music for the film, as a terrorist guard;  and Jim Cramer as himself.  Ghostface Killah had a cameo in a scene where Stark briefly stays in Dubai, but the scene was cut from the theatrical release for pacing reasons. 

==Production==
===Development===
  Ted Elliott, Terry Rossio,  and Tim McCanlies.  McCanliess script used the idea of a Nick Fury cameo to set up his own film.  In June 2001, New Line entered talks with Joss Whedon, a fan of the character, to direct,  and in December 2002, McCanlies had turned in a completed script.  In December 2004, the studio attached director Nick Cassavetes to the project for a target 2006 release.  Screenplay drafts were written by Alfred Gough, Miles Millar and David Hayter, and pitted Iron Man against his father Howard Stark, who becomes War Machine.  

After two years of unsuccessful development, and the deal with Cassavetes falling through, New Line Cinema returned the film rights to Marvel.  In November 2005, Marvel Studios worked to start development from scratch,  and announced Iron Man as their first independent feature, as the character was their only major one not already depicted in live action.  According to associate producer Jeremy Latcham, "we went after about 30 writers and they all passed", saying they were uninterested in the project due to both the relative obscurity of the character and it being a solely Marvel production. Even the rewrites when the film had a script lead to many refusals. 

===Pre-production=== Mark Fergus Ralph Macchio were also called upon by Favreau to give advice on the script.  Favreau, while "trying to   the character of genius billionaire Tony Stark... seem real," took Robert Downey Jr.s suggestion for a meeting with Elon Musk, the founder of SpaceX and Tesla Motors|Tesla. Favreau felt "Downey was right", calling Musk "a paragon of enthusiasm, good humor and curiosity â€” a Renaissance man in an era that needs them." 
 inside references for fans of the comics, such as giving the two fighter jets that attack Iron Man the call signs of "Whiplash 1" and "Whiplash 2," a reference to the comic book villain Blacklash|Whiplash, and including Captain Americas shield in Starks workshop.  The post-credits sequence that introduces Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury was written by comics writer Brian Michael Bendis. 

===Filming===
Production was based in the former  , and other exterior scenes in Afghanistan were filmed at  ".  Filming concluded on June 25, 2007, at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas, Nevada.  Favreau, a newcomer to action films, remarked, "Im shocked that I   on schedule. I thought that there were going to be many curveballs". He hired "people who are good at creating action", so "the human story   like it belongs to the comic book genre".  

There was much improvisation in dialogue scenes, because the script was not completed when filming began (the filmmakers had focused on the story making sense and planning the action). Favreau acknowledged that improvisation would make the film feel more natural. Some scenes were shot with two cameras to capture lines said on the spot. Multiple takes were done, as Downey wanted to try something new each time.  It was Downeys idea to have Stark hold a news conference on the floor,  and he created the speech Stark makes when demonstrating the Jericho weapon.  Brian Michael Bendis wrote three pages of dialogue for the Nick Fury cameo scene, with the filmmakers choosing the best lines for filming.  The cameo was filmed with a skeleton crew in order to keep it a secret, but rumors appeared on the Internet only days later. Marvel Studioss Kevin Feige subsequently had the scene removed from all preview prints in order to maintain the surprise and keep fans guessing. 

===Post-production===
 
Favreau wanted the film to be believable by showing the construction of the suit in its three stages.    and Transformers (film)|Transformers.  The Mark I design was intended to look like it was built from spare parts. The back is less armored than the front, because Stark would use his resources for a forward attack. It also foreshadows the design of Stanes armor. A single   version was built, causing concern when a stuntman fell over inside it, though both the stuntman and the suit were unscathed. The armor was also designed to only have its top half worn at times.  The Embassy created a digital version of the Mark I.  Stan Winston Studios built a  ,   animatronic version of "Iron Monger" (Obadiah Stane),  a name which Obadiah Stane calls Tony Stark and himself earlier in the film as a reference, but is never actually used for the suit itself in the film. The animatronic required five operators for the arm, and was built on a gimbal to simulate walking.  A scale model was used for the shots of it being built. 

The Mark II resembles an airplane prototype, with visible flaps.  Iron Man comic book artist Adi Granov designed the Mark III with illustrator Phil Saunders.  Granovs designs were the primary inspiration for the films, and he came on board the film after he recognized his work on Jon Favreaus MySpace page.  Saunders streamlined Granovs concept art, making it stealthier and less cartoonish in its proportions.  Sometimes, Downey would only wear the helmet, sleeves and chest of the costume over a motion capture suit.  For shots of the Mark III flying, it was animated to look realistic by taking off slowly, and landing quickly. To generate shots of Iron Man and the F-22 Raptors battling, cameras were flown in the air to provide reference for physics, wind and frost on the lenses.  For further study of the physics of flying, skydivers were filmed in a vertical wind tunnel.  Phil Saunders created concept art for the War Machine armor and said that it was originally intended to be used in the film but was "cut from the script about halfway through pre-production." Saunders said that the War Machine armor "was going to be called the Mark IV armor and would have had weaponized swap-out parts that would be worn over the original Mark III armor," and that it "would have been worn by Tony Stark in the final battle sequence." 

==Music==
 
Composer Ramin Djawadi, an Iron Man fan who still has issues of the comic from the late 1970s, has also been into heavy metal music since the early 1990s. While he normally composes after watching an assembly cut, Djawadi began work after seeing the teaser trailer. Favreau clearly envisioned a focus on "heavy" guitar in the score, and Djawadi composed the music on that instrument before arranging it for orchestra. The composer said Downeys performance inspired the several Iron Man themes (for his different moods), as well as Starks playboy leitmotif. Djawadis favorite of the Iron Man themes is the "kickass" because of its "rhythmic pattern that is a hook on its own. Very much like a machine." The other themes are "not so much character based, but rather plot based that carry you through the movie".  Tom Morello of Rage Against the Machine and Audioslave, contributed additional guitar work to the films soundtrack. 

==Release==
The premiere was held at the Greater Union theater at George Street, Sydney, on April 14, 2008.  The film was released in the United States on May 2, 2008,  while the international release was pushed up to April 30, 2008.

=== Critical response===
  normalized weighted average score of 79, based on 38 reviews. 

Among the major trade journals, Todd McCarthy of Variety (magazine)|Variety called the film an "expansively entertaining special effects extravaganza" with "fresh energy and stylistic polish",  while Kirk Honeycutt of The Hollywood Reporter praised the film, while nonetheless finding "disappointment   a climatic   battle between different Iron Man prototypes   how did Tonys nemesis learn how to use the suit?"  In one of the first major-daily newspaper reviews, Frank Lovece of Newsday lauded the films "emotional truth   pitch-perfect casting and plausibly rendered super-science" that made it "faithful to the source material while updating it &ndash; and recognizing whats made that material so enduring isnt just the high-tech cool of a man in a metal suit, but the human condition that got him there".  A. O. Scott of The New York Times called the film "an unusually good superhero picture. Or at least â€“ since it certainly has its problems â€“ a superhero movie thats good in unusual ways."  Among the specialty press, Garth Franklin of Dark Horizons commended the "impressive sets and mechanics that combine smoothly with relatively seamless CG", and said, "Robert Downey Jr., along with director Jon Favreau   help this rise above formula. The result is something that, whilst hardly original or groundbreaking, is nevertheless refreshing in its earnestness to avoid dark dramatic stylings in favor of an easy-going, crowd-pleasing action movie with a sprinkle of anti-war and redemption themes".  
 New York David Denby girl Friday, who loves him but cant say so; Terrence Howard, playing a military man who chases around after Stark, looks dispirited and taken for granted".  IGN s Todd Gilchrist recognized Downey as "the best thing" in a film that "functions on autopilot, providing requisite story developments and character details to fill in this default origin story while the actors successfully breathe life into their otherwise conventional roles".
