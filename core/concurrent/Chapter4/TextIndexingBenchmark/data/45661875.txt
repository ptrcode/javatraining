== Plot ==
The film is not lost, but a modern synopsis has not been published. The official synopsis of the film was published in The Moving Picture World on December 24, 1910.  It states: "Jack Harkaway is of aristocratic birth, being the son of a wealthy Englishmans daughter and a poor young man, with whom she has eloped. Her parents bring about a separation and compel her to place the child in the hands of strangers, who are bribed to keep his whereabouts a secret from his mother. At the age of 12 Jack is placed in a school, the master of which is prejudiced against him, owing to the boys mischievous disposition. After having received severe and unjust punishment from the schoolmaster, Jack decides to run away from school, and escapes from the room in which he is locked, through the window. Wandering along a country road, he accidentally overhears two sneak thieves planning to rob a house. Jack makes his way to the house in time to warn its mistress of the proposed robbery. Two   servants are placed in hiding, when the would-be thieves put in an appearance there and are immediately captured. Jack is given a fine supper by the lady of the house, who is very grateful to him. And when the schoolmaster, accompanied by Jacks guardian, arrives, she is touched by the boys appeal not to be turned over to his rough-looking friends. Upon getting a closer view of the man who calls himself the lads guardian, she realizes that he is the man to whom she was forced to give over her child. The man admits that Jack is her own boy, and the picture ends with the men being turned out of the house and Jack restored to his mothers arms."

==Release and reception ==
The single reel drama, approximately 1,000 feet long, was released on December 23, 1910.    The film had a wide national release, theaters which showed the film are noted in Indiana,  Oklahoma,  South Dakota,  Missouri,  Pennsylvania,  and Arizona.  Reviews of the film were mixed, with the The Moving Picture World describing the film as a "heart story which will interest because it presents more or less unpleasant possibilities of this character. The acting is well done, and the film will prove popular with most audiences."  The New York Dramatic Mirror reviewer found the film to be interesting, but stated that it "would have seemed more natural had   not recognized   as her son until the appearance of  , into whose care she had given her child. If two of the scenes had been broken it might have been more consistent. The men came up to plot their robbery too soon after Jacks hiding. They also appeared in the house immediately after the plan laid to capture them. They surely would have seen the light and would not have ventured so soon." 

A surviving, but very deteriorated 35 mm nitrate print of the film was known to exist in 1988. It was described as being in various states of decomposition throughout the entire reel, including severe shrinkage and brittle or torn perforations. This print is 925 feet long and was held by John E. Allen, Inc. though it is not specifically known if it transferred to the Library of Congress in 1997.
