Delivering is a 1993 short film that Todd Field, while a fellow at the AFI Conservatory, adapted from the story of the same name by Andre Dubus. It is a dramatic piece that takes place on the day two brothers discover their mother has abandoned the family. This film is notable as it was the first time Field adapted Dubus work to film. The next time would be for his Academy Award nominated feature debut, In the Bedroom, which was based on Dubus short story, Killings. Years after Fields graduation from the AFI, Delivering continued to be screened in the classroom.
