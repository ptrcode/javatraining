 musical romantic comedy film starring Jack Carson, Doris Day, and Lee Bowman.

==Plot==

The film opens in Los Angeles, where Doug Blake (Carson) is dumped as a manager by Gary Mitchell (Bowman). He goes to New York City to find a new singer to replace Gary on the Hour of Enchantment radio show. While in New York, he discovers Martha Gibson (Day) turning records on a jukebox factory. He takes her to Los Angeles and tries to introduce her to Felix Hofer (Sakall). His efforts lead to a series of communication failings. 

Meanwhile Martha has begun to fall in love with Gary. Doug takes her to a party at Garys house where Gary gets drunk and is unable to sing on his radio program. Martha replaces him and becomes successful. She replaces Gary on the Hour of Enchantment radio show. Gary, whose ego has driven away all of the people who helped him, cannot find anyone who will hire him or even represent him. Knowing how Martha feels about Gary, Doug helps him come back, but Gary goes back to his old ways and drives Martha away. Martha then realizes that she really loves Doug and makes up with him.

==Production background==

The film serves as a remake to Twenty Million Sweethearts (1934), where the aspiring singer was male. Tucker (2012), p. 107-109 

Eve Arden has a key supporting role as Vivian "Vi" Martin, Doug Blakes co-worker in the radio show The Hour of Enchantment. She is depicted as a highly competent professional woman. She at first agrees to financially support Doug in exchange of half his business earnings. She then agrees to allow Martha and her son Freddie to move in with her. Then, when more is needed to finance Marthas career, Vivian has to sell her own mink coat. 

The film features a love triangle between Doug Blake, Martha Gibson, and Gary Mitchell. Vivian Martin has her own romantic subplot with Thomas Hutchins, though its limited to a few suggestive glances. It was the third and last time that Arden co-worked with Adolphe Menjou. 
 Sheilah Graham, Day missed three days of shooting in May 1948, due to being sick with a fever. 

The film is perhaps best remembered today for an extended dream sequence combining animation and live action which featured a cameo appearance by Bugs Bunny, dancing with Jack Carson and Doris Day to the tune of Hungarian Rhapsody No. 2, which was a favorite of animation director Friz Freleng. The sequence has an Easter theme and features the actors in bunny suits.

==Reception==
The film review of Time (magazine)|Time magazine was not favorable, finding that the film merely reused elements from older films. "It has all been done before- frequently much better". It did, however, find some positive aspects of the film. One was Doris Days singing, another the caustic lines of Eve Arden.  John L. Scot, reviewer for the Los Angeles Times found the basic story trite. But also praised the charm of Doris Day and her ability to sell a tune, while also favoring the comedy performance of Eve Arden.  Richard L. Coe, reviewer of The Washington Post found the film to be a "supremely dull achievement". He found Ardens character wittier and more human than that of Doris Day. 

Tom Santopietro, in a retrospective of the film, credits Arden with the best performance of the film, praising her comic timing.
