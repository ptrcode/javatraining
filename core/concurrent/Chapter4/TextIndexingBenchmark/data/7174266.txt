Parade of the Wooden Soldiers is a 1933 Fleischer Studios animated short film starring Betty Boop.

The instrumental title theme, "Parade of the Wooden Soldiers" (also known as "Parade of the Tin Soldiers"), was composed by Leon Jessel.

==Synopsis==
A large factory complex struggles to produce a single package, which is rushed to a toy store. The box opens, and out steps a Betty Boop doll. The other toys come to life, parade around to the music of Parade of the Wooden Soldiers and crown her their queen. But a large stuffed toy of King Kong begins breaking things up by kidnapping Betty. Eventually, the big ape is defeated, and the (somewhat damaged) toys resume their parade, and afterwards fall still on a counter in a store selling damaged toys.
