Cinema of Unease is the New Zealand contribution to the British Film Institutes Century of Cinema Series. Written and directed by Sam Neill, the title refers to the dark and brooding nature of many of New Zealands most notable films, which Neill considers a reflection of the nations struggle to find, or form, its own identity. It won Best Documentary in the 1996 TV Guide Film and Television awards.  It also screened at the 1995 Cannes Film Festival.
