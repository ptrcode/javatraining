In the Name of the Son is a 2007 drama/thriller short film, set during and after the Bosnian War in present-day Los Angeles, written and directed by Harun Mehmedinović, produced by Vikramadithya Singh with Ajfelov Most as fiscal sponsor.

== History ==
The 25-minute film took a year and a half to complete and premiered at Telluride Film Festival in September, 2007. The film is not autobiographical, but it addresses the breakdown of normal societal ties that everyone in Bosnia witnessed and that Mehmedinović said he could not have written about without experiencing.  

== Plot ==
The Name of the Son is a film that looks at human conflicts in the present, brought about during personal clashes in the Bosnian War in 1994.

After escaping execution, Tarik, a Bosnian prisoner of war, immigrates to the United States looking to leave his past behind. The psychosis of the conflicts that war brought to him when coping with these in civilian life are very hard for him. Years later, the man who spared his life shows up on Tariks doorstep asking for a favor. However, the two main protagonists feelings of guilt and torment are brought to bear with near devastating consequences.

=== Critical reaction ===
Brandon Dumsky of The Standard said that In the Name of the Sons "riveting plot and direction flawlessly display so much tension that it is almost palpable.
