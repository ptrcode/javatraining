 titular Spot, FBI dog that has escaped from a witness protection program and is targeted for killing by a crime boss. The film was shot in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.

== Plot ==
Agent 11 is a crime-fighting bullmastiff used by the FBI; he partners with his master Murdoch in Seattle. As they go after the Mafia boss, Sonny Talia, the dog attacks him and rips off one of his testicles. Talia is taken to the hospital to have it surgically replaced. As payback, he sends his two bodyguards, Gino and Arliss, out to kill Agent 11. For protection, the dog is sent to a training facility in Alaska.

After Agent 11 escapes, he meets Gordon Smith (David Arquette), who works as a Mail carrier|mailman.  The mailman dislikes dogs and has volunteered to take care of James, the young son of his neighbor Stephanie (Leslie Bibb). Gino and Arliss have continued their search for the dog. Agent 11, whom James names "Spot" doesnt want to catch balls or frisbees because Murdoch told him not to play when he was a puppy, but he eventually starts to play with the boy James and Gordon like a normal dog. Later, Gino and Arliss try to kill the dog while he is with Gordon and James at a pet store, but he outsmarts them.

When the FBI finds out that Spot is living with Gordon, they take him back. The dog escapes and finds Gordon and James again. Talia returns and attempts to kill the dog, but is outsmarted, captured and imprisoned.

The FBI agents try to take Spot back, but in the end they decide to let him choose with whom he wants to live. He chooses Gordon and James, although he gives Murdoch a lick goodbye. Stephanie returns and is very upset with Gordon for what had happened, but James convinces Stephanie that Gordon is a good guy, and they end up together. One of the films last scenes is of Talia in prison, his testicles being been replaced by metal balls (the other one having also been bitten off by Spot) that constantly clack together. One inmate calls him "Music Man", and Talia threatens, in a higher voice, "Im gonna catch you in the yard. Were gonna settle this man to man!"
