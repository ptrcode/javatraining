==Plot summary==
Holly Davis is a wife and mother, happily married to Dr. Chip Davis, a seismologist. She isnt aware that Chip is having an affair with Sandy Dunlap, a television news reporter who interviewed him after a quake.

Holly begins teaching aerobics part-time at the gym where she and Sandy meet. Sandy and Holly become fast friends and Hollys children like Sandy as well.  Sandy is a career-minded reporter, trying to become an anchorwoman at the station run by George Margolin. One day at work, a news bulletin reveals the death of Dr. Davis in a car crash.

Holly is devastated by the news and so is Sandy. Helga, the gyms owner is ready to sell so Sandy and Holly invest together. The truth is revealed to Hollys shock one day as she clears out her husbands desk at work where she finds a photo of Sandy and her husband together, clearly indicating evidence of an affair. She angrily confronts Sandy who tells her that she was unaware that her new friend was the wife of the man she loved. Holly angrily ends their friendship.

Sandy begs for forgiveness but Holly is devastated, hurt and angry and refuses to forgive Sandy.  Holly swears she will buy Sandy out of her share of the gym they bought as soon as she is able and refuses to resume the close friendship they once shared.

Sandy discovers that she is pregnant and she tells Holly who is horrified by the news.  Over time, Holly realizes that Sandys child will also be her husbands child so she decides that she should try to forgive Sandy so that she can be a part of the childs life.
