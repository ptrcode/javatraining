==Around the movie==
It was the eleventh MGR-Devar Films.

We can see very clearly, (on 1.02.32. According to copies), a calendar, where is mentioned Tas Press, Madras 7 and Devar Films, Madras 17.

MGR appears only to the twentieth minute of the film. He is introduced by a song in the communist accents, by "Uzhaikkum Kaigale...".

MGR carries a small beard and a beret, he looks like Che Guevara so, a premonitory tribute ! The beard disappears after the marriage of his younger sister.

MGR will find the actor Anandhan under the direction of Pa.Neelakandhan, in the Tamil swashbuckling, color movie of 1971, the fantastic NEERRUM NERRUPPUM.

It is necessary to greet the performance of the big S. A. Asokan in this movie.

The second knives, the shadies in the film take an important place here. what is rare in the Tamil films. MGR and Devar leave them the fields…
 Cucaracha and Tequila (song), one of before 1492 and for the other 1958, with Nagesh-Chowry in Cupid of service.

In the second song of the film "Ethir Paaramal...", one can see a MGR which appears in the shape of Murugan God, whose the great producer Chinnappa Devar was a large known and recognized faithful enthusiast ! The lyrics of the song go in this direction.

K.V.M. always give the best…
