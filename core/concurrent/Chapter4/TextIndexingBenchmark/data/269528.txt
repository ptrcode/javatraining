 sentient after assume control of the world and all human affairs for the good of mankind. 

==Plot== Allied nuclear weapons systems. Being encased within a mountain, it is impervious to attack, powered by its own nuclear reactor. When activated, the President of the United States (Gordon Pinsent) announces its existence, proudly proclaiming Colossus a perfect defense system.

Shortly after, it sends a cryptic message: "FLASH THERE IS ANOTHER MECHANISM". The president learns the Soviets will be activating their own defense computer known as "Guardian". Colossus asks that communications be established, and the president allows a communications link to determine the Soviet computers capabilities.

Once established, Colossus begins sending messages with simple mathematics, becoming increasingly more complex. When Guardian responds, the two machines begin communicating in a binary language which scientists cannot interpret.

This alarms the president and the Soviet General Secretary, who both agree to sever the link. Both machines insist it be restored. When this is refused, Colossus launches a nuclear missile at a USSR oil field and Guardian launches one at Henderson Air Force Base. Demands that the attacks stop are ignored, and the link is hurriedly reconnected. Colossus is able to shoot down the Soviet missile, but the U. S. missile destroys the oil field and a nearby town. Press cover stories are released, and both computers continue without limitation.

 

A meeting between Forbin and his Soviet counterpart, Dr. Kuprin, is arranged. When Colossus learns of it, the computers order Forbin be returned, and Soviet agents are ordered to kill Dr. Kuprin. Forbin is then to be placed under 24-hour surveillance by Colossus.

Before this is done, Forbin meets with his team. He proposes that Dr. Cleo Markham (Susan Clark) pretend to be his mistress in order to keep him informed of all clandestine actions against Colossus.

Concluding the joined computers are impervious to attack, Forbin suggests disarming the missiles to prevent nuclear blackmail. U. S. commanders develop a plan to replace the launch triggers with fakes, but it will take three years to complete the task.

With a voice synthesizer added, Guardian/Colossus announces it is now one entity. It instructs both governments to retarget their nuclear arsenals at those countries not yet under its control. Dr. Forbin sees this as an opportunity to covertly disarm the missiles much faster while carrying out this latest order. The process begins in Colorado and proves successful.

Working by direct personal contact only, the scientists attempt to overload the supercomputer by feeding in test cycles. The attempt fails, and those responsible are immediately executed on order from Guardian/Colossus. Guardian/Colossus then transmits plans for an even larger computer complex to be built into the island of Crete.
 World Control" and declares its mission is to prevent war, as it was designed to do so. Mankind is given the choice between the Cybernetic revolt|"peace of plenty" or one of "unburied dead". It also states that it has detected the attempt to disarm the missiles. It detonates two in their silos "so that you will learn by experience that I do not tolerate interference".

Guardian/Colossus informs Forbin that "freedom is just an illusion" and that "In time you will come to regard me not only with respect and awe, but with love". Forbin angrily replies, "Never!"

==Reception==
 , but its full of surprising moments of humor and intelligence   an unpretentious science fiction film with a satiric point of view   its full of surprising moments of humor and intelligence, a practically perfect movie to see when you want to go to a movie and have nothing special in mind." Canby, Vincent.   The New York Times, May 5, 1970-. 

Dave Kehr, film critic for the Chicago Reader, liked the film, but thought it lacked an "effective ending".  He wrote, "Above-average science fiction (1970), directed in functional hysteric style by Joseph Sargent&nbsp;.... The script, by James Bridges (who went on to write and direct The China Syndrome and Urban Cowboy), is literate and discreet but lacks an effective ending."

Brian Grazer will produce.  Jason Rothenberg has been set to write the screenplay for a movie to be called Colossus. Based on a book by D.F. Jones, the original film was a forerunner of movies like Terminator, introducing the idea of a government-built computer that becomes sentient and then takes control."
