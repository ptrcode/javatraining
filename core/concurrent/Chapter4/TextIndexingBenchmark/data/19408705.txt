==Plot==
During a slow day at school, Alfalfa spends penmanship class writing a note to Spanky, informing his pal that the two "little kids", Buckwheat and Porky, have firecrackers and that Spanky should think of a way to relieve them of their possessions. Alfalfa delivers his note to Spanky via paper airplane, and as soon as recess begins, the two boys stop Buckwheat and Porky at the door and offer to trade a magnifying glass and a water pistol for the firecrackers.

When Buckwheat and Porky refuse their offer, Spanky and Alfalfa sneak into the janitors office and borrow his clothing to disguise themselves as an adult. Spanky sits on Alfalfas shoulders, and also cuts Alfalfas cowlick off to use as a mustache (Alfalfa, upon learning Spanky has shorn him of his trademark: "Im ruined!").

Telling the little kids that hes a G-man, the ersatz Spanky-Alfalfa "adult" succeeds in extracting the firecrackers from Buckwheat. Spanky and Alfafa fail to make an escape, however, without giving away their disguise. Undaunted, Spanky discards the disguise and begins attempting to light the firecrackers with his magnifying glass. Buckwheat gets even with him by sneaking into the classroom and ringing the teachers bell, bringing recess to an early end. As everyone heads inside, Spanky has Alfalfa stuff the firecrackers in his back pocket, and Porky picks up Spankys magnifying glass, which hed left discarded on the ground as he headed back inside.
 The Charge of the Light Brigade," revealing the firecrackers in his back pocket. Using the magnifying glass, Porky trains the light on Alfalfas pocket, setting off the firecrackers so that by the time Alfalfa reaches the "Cannons to the left of me/Cannons to the right of me/Volleyed and thundered" verses of the poem, the poor boys backside is on fire. Alfalfa runs around the classroom and then outside where he puts his rear out in a washtub full of cold water. With his mouth hanging open and his eyes closed, he dunks his rear end into the cold water over and over again. He does this as the rest of the class looks on and begins to laugh at the situation. At first he does not notice them, but then he looks over as he continues to dunk. When Alfalfa sees the whole class staring at him, he turns red and is VERY embarrassed, but cant stop dunking because it feels so good. Hilarious!
