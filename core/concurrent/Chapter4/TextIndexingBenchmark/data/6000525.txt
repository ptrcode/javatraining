 1952 by Paramount Pictures. The working title was At Sea with the Navy. 

This was the fifth film collaboration of Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis, who would make 16 movies together before their partnerships end.

==Plot==
After meeting in the Navy recruiting line, Al Crowthers (Dean Martin) and Melvin Jones (Jerry Lewis) become friends.  Al has tried to enlist before, 11 times, but was always rejected because of a bad knee.  However, he keeps trying so that he can impress women, including Betty Hutton in a cameo role as Hetty Button.  Melvin, meanwhile, is allergic to womens cosmetics and his doctor prescribed ocean travel, so he decided to join the Navy as this was the only way he could afford to follow doctors orders.
 Robert Strauss), a bully they met in line and referred to as fathead.
 Marion Marshall), who does not wear makeup.  However, Melvin seems to attract women to him, and Lardoski wagers with Al that Melvin has to kiss any girl he names.  Al agrees and Lardoski picks Corinne Calvet, who is playing at a nightclub in Honolulu.  The crew then get sent out on the next submarine to Hawaii, in which Melvin is caught on deck when the ship is submerging.  Upon his rescue he is tied to a torpedo for the rest of the voyage to avoid any more incidents.

Once in Hawaii, Al romances Corinne while Melvin also vies for her affection in order to gain a kiss to win the bet which his shipmates have informed him about, and is unsuccessful in comforting Hilda who becomes jealous.  Lardoski tries to prevent the kiss by getting the shore patrol to arrest Melvin, but he disguises himself as a hula dancer and gains the kiss.  Al wins the bet (and Corinne), and Melvin works things out with Hilda.
