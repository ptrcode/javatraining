== Plot ==

Tita, as the youngest daughter in a traditional Mexican family, is forbidden to marry. Her duty is to care for her mother until the day the mother dies. Therefore, when Pedro, the boy Tita has fallen in love with, and his father come to ask for Tita’s hand in marriage, Titas mother, Mama Elena, refuses. Mama Elena offers her other daughter, Rosaura, and Pedro accepts in order to be closer to Tita. Tita bakes the wedding cake with tears, causing vomiting, crying, and a longing for their true love in all those who eat it.

A year later, and Titas emotions again infuse a meal that she cooks. Her heat and passion transfers to her sister Gertrudis, who, overcome with lust, attempts to cool down by taking a shower, only to be scooped up and carried off by a passing revolutionary soldier.

Rosaura gives birth to a baby boy, but Tita is the one who is able to nurse the child. Mama Elena is suspicious of Titas intentions toward Pedro, and sends Rosaura and Pedro away. Tita blames the consequent death of the baby on her mother and, grief-stricken, Tita falls into a catatonic-like state.

Dr. John Brown, a kind and considerate man, takes Tita away to care for her in Texas. Tita eventually enters into a relationship with Dr. Brown after recovering, and reluctantly plans to marry him.

The sound track near the beginning and more explicitly near the end of the film recognizably quotes a passage from Wagners opera, Tristan und Isolde. The plot of that opera can be related to the theme of the movie: Tristan and Isolde unknowingly drink a love potion that causes them to fall insatiably in love with each other, but they are unable to consummate the love because Isolde is destined to marry King Mark. At the end they both die. The musical passage represents the passion of their unfulfilled longing.
Mama Elena is killed by revolutionaries, so Rosaura and Pedro return for the funeral.

Rosaura soon gives birth to a second child, Esperanza. Soon after, Dr. Brown is called away and Pedro and Tita succumb to their emotions and sleep together. Mama Elena returns to haunt Tita, convincing her that she is pregnant with Pedros child. That night, Gertrudis returns to the ranch as a general with her revolutionary husband. She helps Tita banish Mama Elena and realize that her pregnancy was imaginary. Upon Dr. Browns return, Tita tells him that she slept with another man and he reluctantly allows her to break their engagement.

Twenty years pass, and Rosaura dies of "severe digestive problems". Pedro confesses to Tita that he still loves her, and wants to marry her. Tita and Pedro then make love, but Pedro dies just as he has a sensuous orgasm. Tita then swallows matches, setting the entire ranch on fire in the process. The daughter of Esperanza, nicknamed "Tita" after her great-aunt, returns to the ranch and finds only Tita’s cookbook, which contained her recipes and told of her and Pedro’s love story.
