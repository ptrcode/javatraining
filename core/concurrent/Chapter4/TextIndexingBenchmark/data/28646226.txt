==Plot==
 
A female loggerhead turtle follows the path of her ancestors on one of the most extraordinary journeys in the natural world. From a beach in Florida, she rides the Gulf Stream to the frozen north, swimming around the entire North Atlantic to Africa   and then back to the beach where she was born. But her chance of survival is low.  Each season, two million loggerhead turtles are hatched but just one in ten thousand turtles will return safely to lay their eggs.
