 1982 remake) American black-and-white science fiction/horror horror film Robert Cornthwaite, and Douglas Spencer. James Arness played The Thing, but he is difficult to recognize in costume and makeup, due to both low lighting and other effects used to obscure his features. The film is based on the 1938 novella "Who Goes There?" by John W. Campbell (writing under the pseudonym of Don A. Stuart). Warren  1982, pp. 151–163. 

The story concerns a U.S. Air Force crew and scientists who find a crashed flying saucer and a body frozen nearby in the Arctic ice. Returning to their remote research outpost with the humanoid body in a block of ice, they are forced to defend themselves against this malevolent, plant-based alien when it is accidentally revived. 

==Plot==
A United States Air Force crew is dispatched by General Fogerty (David McMahon) from Anchorage, Alaska at the request of Dr. Carrington (Robert Cornthwaite), the chief scientist of a North Pole scientific outpost. They have evidence that an unknown flying craft crashed nearby, so Reporter Ned Scott (Douglas Spencer) tags along for the story.

Dr. Carrington later briefs Captain Hendry (Kenneth Tobey) and his airmen, and Dr. Redding shows photos of a flying object moving erratically before crashing; not the movements of a   heat bombs, but only ignite its metal alloy, causing an explosion that destroys the saucer. Their Geiger counter then points to a slightly radioactive frozen shape buried nearby in the refrozen ice.

As the ice slowly melts, the thing inside revives; Barnes panics and begins shooting at it with his .45 caliber sidearm, but the alien escapes into the sub-zero cold of the raging storm.

Seed pods are quickly discovered in the palm. The Air Force personnel believe the creature is a danger to all of them but Carrington is convinced that it can be reasoned with and has much to teach them. Carrington deduces their visitor requires blood to survive and reproduce. He later discovers the body of a dead sled dog in the outposts greenhouse; the alien has forced the lock on the greenhouses door and bent it back into shape. Carrington has Dr. Voorhees (Paul Frees), Dr. Olsen (William Neff) and Dr. Auerbach stand guard overnight, waiting for it to return.

An airman throws a pick axe along the floor at the creature, forcing it to step on to their grid-trap. On Hendrys direct order that nothing of the thing remain, it is reduced by arcs of electricity to a smoldering pile of ash; Dr.Carringtons growing seed pods and the things severed arm are then destroyed. When the weather clears, Scotty files his "story of a lifetime" by radio to a roomful of reporters in Anchorage. During his report, Scotty broadcasts a warning to the reporters: "Tell the world. Tell this to everybody, wherever they are. Watch the skies everywhere. Keep looking. Keep watching the skies."

===Director=== RKO Radio Pictures Inc. Hawks gave Nyby only $5,460 of the $50,000 directors fee that RKO paid and kept the rest, but Hawks denied that he directed the film. 

Cast members disagree on Hawks and Nybys contributions. Tobey said that "Hawks directed it, all except one scene" Matthews    while, on the other hand, Fenneman said that "Hawks would once in a while direct, if he had an idea, but it was Chris show." Cornthwaite said that "Chris always deferred to Hawks, ... Maybe because he did defer to him, people misinterpreted it."  Although Self has said that "Hawks was directing the picture from the sidelines", Weaver    he also has said that "Chris would stage each scene, how to play it. But then he would go over to Howard and ask him for advice, which the actors did not hear ... Even though I was there every day, I dont think any of us can answer the question. Only Chris and Howard can answer the question." 
 William Self, later became President of 20th Century Fox Television.  In describing the production, Self said, "Chris was the director in our eyes, but Howard was the boss in our eyes." Fuhrmann, Henry   Los Angeles Times, April 20, 2012. Retrieved: May 25, 1997.

Bosley Crowther in The New York Times observed, "Taking a fantastic notion (or is it, really?), Mr. Hawks has developed a movie that is generous with thrills and chills…Adults and children can have a lot of old-fashioned movie fun at The Thing, but parents should understand their children and think twice before letting them see this film if their emotions are not properly conditioned."   "Gene" in Variety (magazine)|Variety complained that the film "lacks genuine entertainment values." Willis 1985, p. 86.  More than 20 years after its theatrical release, science fiction editor and publisher Lester del Rey compared the film unfavorably to the source material, John W. Campbells Who Goes There?, calling it "just another monster epic, totally lacking in the force and tension of the original story." 
 review aggregate website Rotten Tomatoes, with the consensus that the film "is better than most flying saucer movies, thanks to well-drawn characters and concise, tense plotting."  In 2001, the United States Library of Congress deemed the film "culturally significant" and selected it for preservation in the National Film Registry.  
   National Film Registry (National Film Preservation Board, Library of Congress). Retrieved: November 26, 2011.  Additionally, Time (magazine)|Time magazine named The Thing from Another World  "the greatest 1950s sci-fi movie."
