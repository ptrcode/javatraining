== Plot ==

In Pittsburgh|Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, a man drives a van into a parking garage across the Allegheny River from PNC Park and, after dropping a quarter into the meter, readies a sniper rifle. He takes aim and kills five people on the river’s North Shore Trail from long range before fleeing in the van.

The police soon arrive at the scene of the murder, headed by Detective Emerson (David Oyelowo), and discover a shell casing as well as the quarter used to pay for parking. A fingerprint taken from the coin points to James Barr (Joseph Sikora), a former United States Army|U.S. Army sniper. When the police raid his house, they find the van, equipment for reloading rifle cartridges, the rifle in question, and Barr, fast asleep in his bed.
 Military Police Corps officer. Reacher later arrives in Pittsburgh after seeing a news report about Barr and the shooting. Emerson and Rodin deny Reacher’s request to view the evidence but agree to let him see the suspect. Barr, as it turns out, was brutally attacked by fellow inmates while in police custody and is now in a coma. Reacher meets Barr’s defense attorney, counselor Helen Rodin (Rosamund Pike), the District Attorney’s daughter, whos been saddled with the apparently hopeless task of saving Barr from the death penalty.
 killing spree during his tour in Iraq but was not prosecuted because, unknown to Barr, his victims were under investigation for multiple rapes — and the U.S. Army wants them forgotten. Reacher vowed that if Barr tried anything like this again, he would take him down.

Reacher agrees to investigate if Helen visits the victims’ families to learn about the people murdered that day. Reacher goes to the crime scene and finds inconsistencies about this location, thinking that a trained shooter would have done the killings from the cover of the van on the nearby Fort Duquesne Bridge. After Helen reports her findings about the victims to Reacher, he suggests that the owner of a local construction company was the intended victim, with the killing of the other victims intended as a cover-up.

After an apparently spurious bar fight, Reacher realizes that someone is attempting to strong-arm him into dropping his investigation. Reacher is later framed for the murder of the young woman who was paid to instigate the bar-room brawl, but this only motivates him further. Reacher eventually follows up a lead at a shooting range in the neighboring state of Ohio, owned by former United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marine Corps Gunnery Sergeant Martin Cash (Robert Duvall), who will talk only if Reacher will demonstrate his U.S. Army sniping skills.

The real perpetrators are the members of a Russian gang, who are masquerading as legitimate businessmen. The gangs elderly leader (Werner Herzog) spent much of his life in a Soviet Gulag and is known only as the Zec (prisoner). The gang kidnaps Helen with the aid of Detective Emerson and holds her hostage at a quarry. Reacher outwits the mob guards, killing them with Cashs help, before confronting the Zec about the conspiracy. Zec points out that Reacher has killed most of the witnesses against him and doubts that he would be convicted. In the interest of justice Reacher shoots the Zec in the head on the spot.

Reacher and Cash flee the scene with confidence that Helen will clear Reachers name. When Barr awakens from his coma, he tells Helen that he has no recent memory but believes that he must be guilty of the shootings. Barrs mental reconstruction of how he would have committed the shootings confirms that Reachers theory was correct from the beginning. Still unaware of all these developments, Barr is willing to confess and accept his punishment, fearing that Reacher will mete out justice if the law does not.

== Production ==
 Jack Reacher Killing Floor. optioned with PolyGram and One Shot (2005).  In July 2010, Christopher McQuarrie, who previously collaborated with Cruise/Wagner Productions on the 2008 film Valkyrie (film)|Valkyrie, signed on to rework Olsons script and ultimately direct the film.  

=== Casting ===

In June 2011, Tom Cruise was in talks of playing the role of Jack Reacher.  The following month, Cruise closed a deal with the studios and signed on for the part.    Some fans of the novel series became vocal over the casting of Cruise due to actors stature not matching the description of Reacher in the novels.   Explaining the casting decision, author Lee Child said that it would be impossible to find a suitable actor to play the giant Reacher and to recreate the feel of the book onscreen, and that Cruise had the talent to make an effective Reacher.  Child also said, "Reachers size in the books is a metaphor for an unstoppable force, which Cruise portrays in his own way."  Of Cruises relatively small stature, Child said, "With another actor you might get 100% of the height but only 90% of Reacher. With Tom, youll get 100% of Reacher with 90% of the height."   

Following the casting of Cruise, Rosamund Pike was cast as the female lead.  Other actresses who were in the running for the role include Hayley Atwell and Alexa Davalos.  By September 2011, the main cast was locked with the hiring of David Oyelowo, Richard Jenkins, Jai Courtney, and Robert Duvall.   Werner Herzog, primarily known for his directorial work, rounded out the cast in October 2011 when he signed on to play the films villain. 

=== Filming ===

Production on the film began in October 2011.  Cruise performed all of his own driving stunts during the films signature car chase sequence.  "Action to me is something very fun to shoot. The challenge in most car chases is youre trying to hide the fact that its not the actor driving," McQuarrie said. "The challenge here was the exact opposite. We were trying to find a way to show that it was always Tom driving. Hes literally driving in every stunt sequence."   

In February 2012, Kevin Messick, one of the films producers, sued Don Granger and Gary Levinsohn, two other producers, for breach of contract over a Joint Venture Agreement, claiming he had "helped to develop the film, renew Paramounts options for the rights to the book, and participated in the search for a screenwriter" but starting in July 2010, had been left out of meetings with the screenwriter and the studio and not given certain drafts of the screenplay while it was under development.  Messick is suing for "unspecified damages, his producers fees and the right to participate in any upcoming sequels." 

=== Music ===
 Joe Kraemer, who previously scored director McQuarries The Way of the Gun (2000). Kraemer was announced as the composer for the film in July 2012, having already started work on it.  After spending eight weeks working with McQuarrie on materials to present to producers, Kraemers hiring was approved and he directly began working on the films opening eight minutes.    "I have a number of tricks that I use to spark the creative process," said Kraemer on his scoring process after having seen the film. "Sometimes I’ll use my mathematical understanding of music to devise a theme (such as the open fifths of Reacher’s theme), sometimes I’ll have an orchestral color in mind (i.e. the music for THE ZEC). The actual composing process probably resembles Max Steiner more than anyone else I know of. I start at the first frame of the movie and work my through to the end, chronologically, in order." 

The film is noted for its balance between music and silence, with music primarily absent or reserved during a majority of the films action sequences.   Discussing his approach to this balance, Kraemer described, "Music can make such an impact when it enters a scene, and obviously the only way to do that is to have silence beforehand. I also generally like to have long tails on my cues so that they sort of fade away rather than ending abruptly. In this way, I try to weave music in and out very carefully so that the audience is as unaware as possible of the entrances and exits. I often cite Patton (film)|Patton as a prime example of great spotting - a three and half hour biopic with, what, twenty-eight minutes of score? That’s unheard of today. But it worked!" 

The score was performed by the Hollywood Studio Symphony and recorded at the Sony Scoring Stage in Culver City, California.  A soundtrack album for the film was released on December 18, 2012 by La-La Land Records.

== Distribution ==

=== Marketing ===
 trailer for Jack Reacher was officially released on Cruises birthday,  , 2012. 

=== Theatrical release ===
 World War Z back six months. 

The film was released in North American markets on December 21, 2012, with a premiere initially planned for Pittsburghs SouthSide Works megaplex on December 15, 2012, which was to be attended by the films stars, and Child. 

On December 15, 2012, Paramount Pictures announced it was indefinitely postponing the films premiere screening in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania out of respect for the families of the victims of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting that had occurred the day before. The opening scene shows a sniper shooting at people including a woman holding a small child, and one point aiming the cross-hairs directly at her.    Writer-director McQuarrie endorsed the decision, saying he and Cruise "insisted upon it. Nobody should be celebrating anything 24 hours after a tragic event like that. We thought long and hard about it. This was not a snap judgment, because we wanted to give back to the city of Pittsburgh  , because they were so great to us." 

The film held its United Kingdom premiere on December 10, 2012 at Londons Odeon Leicester Square.  It was released on December 26, 2012 in the U.K.
