 psychological thriller sociopath and a master of disguise who escapes a sanitarium and enters the life of a single mother with the intent of marrying her, murdering everyone who gets in his way. The cast includes Meg Foster, Caroline Williams and Jonathan Brandis.

== Plot == Washington since, Dream House.

Arriving in Palm Meadows, Gene meets Carol Grayland (who coincidentally held a real estate job position that used to be Genes when he was still Jerry Blake) and leases a house just across the street from her and her son Todd. During a session with the wives of the neighborhood, Gene learns Carols dentist husband, Philip, had absconded with his mistress the previous year. Gene begins courting Carol, eventually winning over her and Todd. Genes plan to marry Carol is soon complicated when Phil returns, wanting to reconcile with his wife. Needing Phil out of the way, Gene persuades Carol to send Phil over for a meeting, during which Gene kills him with a broken bottle, covering up Phils disappearance afterwards by making it look as though he simply ran off again. With Phil gone, Gene and Carol arrange to get married.

Local mail carrier Madeline "Matty" Crimmins (who is a friend of Carols) begins looking through Genes mail, finding a letter addressed to the real Gene Clifford (which includes a photograph revealing him to be African American). Confronted by Matty (who wants to know who he really is) in the park, Gene persuades her to let him tell Carol the truth about his past, though this turns out to be a lie. Later that night, Gene strangles Matty to death, making her death resemble a suicide by hanging. On his way out Gene takes Mattys last bottle of wine and crosses through the yard of Mattys blind neighbor Sam Watkins, who hears Gene whistling "Camptown Races," which he mentions to Carol the next day.

Despite Mattys death, at Genes insistence, the wedding proceeds as planned. While dressing in the church, Carol recognizes bottles of wine sent by Mattys parents as the same brand Gene had the other night, and overhears Todd whistling "Camptown Races", which he says Gene taught him. Thinking Gene may have had something to do with Mattys death, Carol confronts him, prompting Gene to attack Carol and Todd, the latter of whom he locks in a storage closet. As Gene prepares to kill Carol in the reception area, Todd breaks out of the closet and saves his mother, stabbing Gene in the chest with a claw hammer, seemingly killing him.

==Production== Harvey and Bob Weinstein complained about the lack of blood and demanded re-shoots. Jeff Burr refused and another director was hired to do the reshoots. In an interview, Burr commented, "they cut a little bit of   out and they added some badly done blood effects. Badly done, because Terry Oâ€™Quinn refused to do it. Really, they were meaningless, so that was irritating." 

== Release ==
Stepfather II was originally intended to be released direct to video; however, the producers were impressed enough with the sequel that it was released into theaters.  The film was given a limited release theatrically in the United States by Millimeter Films in November 1989.   It grossed $1,519,796 domestically at the box office.
