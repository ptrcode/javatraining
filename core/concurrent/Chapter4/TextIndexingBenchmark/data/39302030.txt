==Plot==
When the boxer Billy Roberts (Conway) is married to the laundress Saxon (Stedman),  he tries to please his spouse by leaving his former profession behind and becoming a teamster driving trucks. However, when their wages are cut, the union calls for a strike.  The film is sympathetic toward the strikers, with scenes showing police attacking the teamsters with clubs and patrol wagons being driven over fallen men.  The former boxer is attacked and beaten by company scabs, lands in jail following a brawl, and starts drinking. The desperate couple decide to move to the country and start a new life on a farm. With money being tight, he enters a fight for a $300 prize. In the end he wins, and the couple depart to live at their "Valley of the Moon".
