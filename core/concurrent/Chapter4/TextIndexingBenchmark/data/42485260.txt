Lion Down is a 1951 Goofy cartoon featuring Goofy and Louie the Mountain Lion. The films plot centers on Goofy and Louie competing for a comfortable place to rest. The film is Louies third appearance.    

==Plot==
Goofy is trying to enjoy some peace and quiet on his hammock, but cant find two trees to link it to. It is revealed that Goofy has a mock backyard on top of a huge skyscraper. To get a new tree, he heads out of the city and into the country to get a tree, but it is the home of Louie the Mountain Lion. Goofy and Louie begin competing for the hammock and tree (for example, they push each other off by sneaking in after placing a doorbell call). In the end, Goofy and Louies competition for a resting place makes them both hang from a pole far above the ground. When the hammock breaks free, they go on what is similar to the magic carpet ride in Aladdin (1992 Disney film)|Aladdin. Goofy and Louie decide to go their own ways, with Goofy staying where he is and Louie heading back to the countryside.
