On his spring break at the Romanian Black Sea resorts|seaside, with his wife and his four-year-old son, Bogdan Ciocăzanu (a.k.a. Boogie) runs into his best friends from high-school at the precise date and time that reminds all of them of their most glorious drinking trips and sexual escapades of their younger days. Frustrated that, between his job and his family, time is no longer his to manage and play with, Boogie now takes his shock dosage of freedom and spends a night to tick off all the items on the map of his youth (drinking, games, flirting, prostitutes).
