Crazy People (stylized as Cяazy People) is a 1990 comedy film starring Dudley Moore and Daryl Hannah, and directed by Tony Bill.

==Plot==
Emory Leeson is an advertising executive who experiences a nervous breakdown. He designs a series of "truthful" advertisements, blunt and bawdy and of no use to his boss Druckers firm.

One of his colleagues, Stephen Bachman, checks him into a psychiatric hospital. Emory goes into group therapy under the care of Dr. Liz Baylor and meets other voluntary patients, such as the lovely and vulnerable Kathy Burgess.  There is also George, who can only speak one word: "Hello."

By mistake, Emorys advertisements get printed and the new campaign turns out to be a tremendous success. Campaigns like: "Jaguar — For men whod like hand-jobs from beautiful women they hardly know." and "Volvo — theyre boxy but theyre good."

Drucker grabs credit for the ads.  He assigns Stephen and the rest of his employees to design similar new ad campaigns featuring so-called honesty in advertising, but nothing works.

Emory is approached in the sanitarium about creating new ads himself. He insists that his fellow mental patients also be involved and suitably rewarded for their work, transforming the sanitarium into a branch of the advertising industry.
 French can be annoying. Come to Greece.  Were nicer."  And another one called "Come… IN the Bahamas" for the islands national tourism board. 

The patients experience happiness at being needed and improve from their various illnesses. The evil Drucker and the doctor in charge of the hospital get greedy and try to separate the team.  But it doesnt work. Dr. Baylor defies her boss and Emory negotiates to get new automobiles for all of the patients. Emory and Kathy, who have fallen in love, leave the hospital in an army helicopter piloted by Kathys long-lost brother.
