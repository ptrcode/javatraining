==Quotes==
Igor Maslennikov said about the film: 
* "Queen of Spades" came out in me absolutely by such as I wanted her to see - not only as the motion picture director, but as men with the classical philological education. We brought to the consciousness of a spectator the authentic, true text of this piece of Pushkin, and indeed many receive "Queen of Spades" using the material of Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky|Tchaikovskys opera. There is even guide on Petersburg, in which under the photograph of winter groove stands the signature: "the winter groove, in which was drowned Pushkins Liza". Here immediately several errors. It suffices to say that anywhere Pushkin does not have any Liza, but Lizaveta Ivanovna, who safely marry... And here these myths we attempted to destroy....
* ... most important myth - about Hermann, who by Pushkin not was neither demonic nor romantic hero. This is such kind of nemchik, which in Petersburg there was much - 30% of population. Pushkin irritated all of them, to Hermann he gave the pejorative characteristic: no one of the officers perceived nonsense about the three cards, the very same to this believed; passing by the house of the countess, he saw her niece and began to letter her. But not his own, but he copied pages from the German novels.
