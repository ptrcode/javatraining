==Plot==
Wallace (Daniel Radcliffe) has a miserable job and lives with his sister and nephew in Toronto, Ontario. He dropped out of medical school after becoming aware of his girlfriend having an affair with his Anatomy teacher and decides to not be social for a year. He is coerced by Allan (Adam Driver) into going to a party where he quickly gets bored and begins to amuse himself by arranging fridge magnets bearing single words into phrases.

While playing he is joined by Allans cousin Chantry (Zoe Kazan) and the two fall into conversation. At the same time Allan meets Nicole (Mackenzie Davis) and they begin flirting with each other. Chantry and Wallace leave the party and he walks her home where he finds out that Chantry has a boyfriend. Even so, she gives him her phone number, but he decides against pursuing the idea of going out with her. He soon changes his mind about this when they run into each other in a movie theater, where they had both gone alone, and end up having dinner together.

Over time the friendship grows and Wallace is invited to meet Ben (Rafe Spall), Chantrys long-term boyfriend, who works for the United Nations. Ben, however, ends up in the hospital due to a series of unexpected accidents when Wallace visits their house for the first time. At the hospital Wallace and Chantry run into Wallaces ex-girlfriend, Megan. Ben later moves to Dublin, Ireland for six months due to requirements of his job. During this time Wallace and Chantry begin to see their relationship develop further and they begin to have deeper feelings for each other. Even when Dalia (Megan Park), Chantrys sister, tries to seduce Wallace in her car he is unable to reciprocate, because Wallace is worried that it would ruin any chance he would have with Chantry. From then on Dalia only speaks negatively of Wallace to Chantry.

Allan and Nicole get married and later invite Wallace and Chantry to have a walk in the beach at night. They decide to go skinny dipping and soon Wallace and Chantry decide to join, whereupon Allan and Nicole steal their clothes, forcing them to sleep naked together on the beach. Wallace and Chantry feel forced into the intimate situation and begrudgingly decide to share the sleeping bag. The next day they leave the beach angrily.

Chantry is offered a promotion to direct an animated project in Taiwan. However, she is pressured because of her strained relationship with Ben so she travels to Dublin to join him. On arriving she discovers that Ben has accepted more work commitments that require him to travel frequently and they decide to break off the relationship. Meanwhile Wallace decides to follow Chantry; upon arriving Ben punches him in the face, knocking him down the front stairs. He then checks his voicemail, learning that she has returned to Toronto. They meet, but Wallace tells Chantry about the trip and his feelings for her and she responds extremely unfavorably.

Wallace considers going back to medical school and moving on with his life; however, he decides to attend Chantrys farewell party and they have a tearful goodbye. They finally admit to their mutual feelings while giving each other a Fools Gold Loaf|Fools Gold Sandwich, something they had previously discussed while hanging out together, and kiss.

In an epilogue set 18 months later, it is revealed that Wallace followed Chantry to Taiwan and proposed to her there, while he completed his medical studies. They marry, and contemplate on the rest of their lives while sitting on Wallaces rooftop.

 Toronto answer Sundance breakout hit 500 DAYS OF SUMMER. Like that movie, it takes a stale genre, and gives it a hip indie twist. It is director Michael Dowses follow-up to GOON, and just like that film, its hilariously foul script disguises a surprisingly soft, big-hearted centre".    Betsy Sharkey of the Los Angeles Times thought it was "the best, and sweetest, of the filmmaker’s work yet".   

The Guardian scored the film two out of five stars, saying it was "really hard to finish" and "liable to leave you queasy".    Eric Kohn of IndieWire wrote, "The movie primarily frustrates by doing nothing fresh. Careening toward an overly neat and tender resolution, "The F Word" lacks the gall to let its uncoordinated characters wind up victims of their situation".
