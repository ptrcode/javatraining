==Critical reception==
 
Jeannette Catsoulis, film critic for The New York Times liked the film, especially the acting of Valeria Bertuccelli and Ingrid Rubio, and wrote, "Though constrained by a directing style that insists on coloring within the lines, the movie is most successful in the rocky emotional spaces in which the sisters renegotiate their relationship and in which Elena, struggling with English, endures the painful process of assimilation...both actresses make their director look very good indeed." 
 . The New York Times, film review, "A Long Way Traveled, With Farther Still to Go," December 6, 2006. 
 The Motorcycle Diaries. The complex plot doesnt fully exploit the possibilities for suspense, but first-class perfs, great atmospherics and an upbeat message combine to make the pic work better as a sibling drama than as a thriller." 

Critic V.A. Mesetto thought the screenplay was predictable but also likes the acting, and wrote, "Solomonoff draws out vivid performances by Valeria Bertuccelli (Elena) and Ingrid Rubio (Natalia) that make up for the scripts predictability." 

Film critic Ed Gonzalez wrote, "Solomonoff doesnt strike very interesting contrasts between past and present, but her actresses certainly do: Rubio and Bertucelli express how resentment eats away at their characters sisterhood so richly that the many flashbacks to Argentina, shot uninterestingly in gritty hand-held gestures, seem almost unnecessary."
