}} Adalberto Martínez "Resortes", and Pancho Córdova. The film was shot at Tlayacapan, Morelos, Mexico.

==Plot==
In the small town of Chipitongo the Alto, the political boss Don Mario N. Cruz is the only presidential candidate of that municipality. When the towns clumsy and blind pressman Don Casimiro Buenavista prints "María" instead of "Mario" on all the ballots, the presidential candidacy automatically reverts to María Nicolasa Cruz, an illiterate and indigenous potter. Once informed, María Nicolasa accepts her new job as municipal president of Chipitongo el Alto only to rebuke the towns corrupt secretaries. Mario Nicanor Cruz, the former candidate, plans several schemes along with Lawyer Topillo in order to get rid of María.
