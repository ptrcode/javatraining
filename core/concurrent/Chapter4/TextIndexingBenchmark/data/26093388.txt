Baby Blue Marine is a 1976 Metrocolor film set during World War II that was directed by John D. Hancock. It stars Jan-Michael Vincent and Glynnis OConnor.

Film critic Roger Ebert gave the film 2½ out of 4 stars. 

==Plot== Flying Cadets prior to Pearl Harbor; hence the name "Baby Blue Marine" for a failed recruit.

Ashamed, Marion meets Raider, a Marine Raider (Richard Gere in his second big screen appearance) a young, battle-scarred war hero back from the Pacific who has aged beyond his years with prematurely gray hair. As the Raider doesnt wish to return to the war, he knocks out Marion and changes uniforms with him.

Marion enters an idyllic small town where the decorations and Raider shoulder sleeve insignia of his uniform make him a hero to the community whose own young men are away at the war.
