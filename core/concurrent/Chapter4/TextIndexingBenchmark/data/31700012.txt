==Plot== Patrick Wilson) and his wife Beth (Elizabeth Reaser). Believing this to be a sign she and Buddy are meant to be together, Mavis leaves Minneapolis and returns to her hometown of Mercury, Minnesota, to reclaim her life with Buddy, under the pretext of overseeing a real estate deal.

Upon arriving after listening to "The Concept" by Teenage Fanclub on repeat from an old mixtape Buddy gave her in high school, Mavis arranges to meet him the next day at a local sports bar, for old times sake. In the interim, she goes alone to a different bar, Woodys. There she reconnects with a former classmate she barely remembers, Matt Freehauf (Patton Oswalt), who became disabled after being beaten by jocks who erroneously assumed he was gay. Matt tells Mavis that her plan to destroy Buddys marriage is irrational and selfish, but she ignores him.

The following day, Mavis meets Buddy at the sports bar, where they run into Matt, the bars bookkeeper. On their way out, Buddy invites Mavis to a performance of Beths "mom rock band". In the interim, Mavis spends another night getting drunk with Matt, who distills homemade bourbon in the garage of the house he shares with his sister Sandra. When Mavis attends the concert of Beths band, the other moms are resentful of Mavis, whom they remember as the "psychotic prom queen bitch". When Beths band performs, the lead singer dedicates their opening song to Buddy from Beth; much to Maviss dismay, it is "The Concept".

Beth wants to stay out longer, so Mavis offers to drive the drunk Buddy home. On the lawn they share a kiss that is quickly broken up when the babysitter opens the front door to greet them. The next day, after an awkward encounter with her parents, Mavis is invited to Buddys daughters naming ceremony. She later goes out drinking with Matt again, during which Matt tells Mavis to grow up. The following day, Mavis attends the party, where she declares her love for Buddy, but he rebuffs her. Everyone at the party is called out to the lawn to await a surprise Buddy has prepared for Beth. Mavis, who has been drinking at the party, collides with Beth, who accidentally spills punch on Maviss dress. Mavis insults her, and in a profanity-laced tirade tearfully reveals she became pregnant with Buddys baby years ago, but had a miscarriage after three months.

Buddy, who has been preparing a drum-set gift for Beth in the garage, opens the garage door and belatedly learns what has transpired. Mavis asks him why he invited her. He reveals it was Beths idea, as she feels sorry for Mavis. Humiliated, Mavis leaves the party and visits Matt, where she breaks down in tears and, later, initiates sex. The following morning, while Matt sleeps, Mavis has coffee in the kitchen with Sandra, who still idolizes her. Mavis talks about needing to change herself, but Sandra says Mavis is better than the rest of Mercury and should not change. Mavis says she agrees, and prepares to return to Minneapolis. Sandra asks to go with her but Mavis declines and leaves alone.

In a diner on her way home, Mavis writes the last chapter of the book, in which the main character graduates high school, quickly leaves her past behind and looks forward to the future. Afterward, in the parking lot, Mavis contemplates her crumpled car.

==Production==
Screenwriter Diablo Cody said the genesis of the film came from her encounters with the press:
 
 Labor Day, White Plains, New City, Port Chester, Garden City Massapequa Park, the last of which included Woodys Village Saloon. A few days were also shot on a soundstage at JC Studios in Brooklyn. 

After Charlize Theron and Patrick Wilson were cast, Patton Oswalt was signed after doing a table read-through of the script at Reitmans house.  Oswalt said that because his character, Matt Freehauf, had been badly beaten as a teen and was required to walk with a brace, he consulted with both an acting coach and a physical therapist to prepare for the role: "I just wanted less and less to have to think about so I could be more present in the scenes with Charlize. Shes a really instinctual actor and I really didnt want to be sitting there with eight other thoughts on my head while shes just rolling with it." 

Young Adult was screened out of competition at the 62nd Berlin International Film Festival. 

==Critical reception==
The film has received generally positive reviews, scoring 80% positive reviews out of 173 from critics on Rotten Tomatoes. Its consensus states: "Despite its somewhat dour approach, Young Adult is a funny and ultimately radical no-holds-barred examination of prolonged adolescence, thanks largely to a convincing performance by Charlize Theron." 
 Thank You Up in the Air, Jason Reitman has an incredible track record. Those films were all so rewarding. The character of Mavis makes Young Adult tricky to process. As I absorbed it, I realized what a fearless character study it is. That sometimes its funny doesnt hurt."  Kyle Buchanan of Vulture calls Mavis "a woman that dares the audience to dislike her",  but 
Maureen Johnson of the Huffington Post states something else is going on: "Mavis Gary is mentally ill. (...) Mavis suffers from Mood disorder|depression, alcoholism, and trichotillomania (obsessive hair pulling)." 

Tom Long of   awarded the film an A grade, stating "Charlize Theron delivers one of the most impressive performances of the year". 

The film also appeared on many critics lists of the best films of 2011.
