 black comedy about a mans failed attempt to murder his wife, whom he believes has been unfaithful to him.  Although the film, which was the first of two Sturges made for Twentieth Century-Fox, received mostly positive reviews, it was not successful at the box office. 

==Plot==
Sir Alfred de Carter (Rex Harrison) is a world-famous symphony conductor who returns from a visit to his native England and discovers that his rich and boring brother-in-law, August Henshler (Rudy Vallee), has misunderstood Alfreds casual instruction to watch over his much younger wife Daphne (Linda Darnell) while he was away, and instead hired a detective named Sweeney (Edgar Kennedy) to follow her.  Alfred is livid, and ineptly attempts to destroy any evidence of the detectives report.

Eventually, despite his efforts, he learns the content of the report directly from Sweeney: while he was gone, his wife was spied late at night going to the hotel room of Alfreds secretary, Anthony Windborn (Kurt Kreuger), a man closer in age to her own, where she stayed for thirty-eight minutes.
 Francesca da Rimini.)

After the concert, Alfred tries to stage his fantasy of murdering his wife, but is thwarted by his own ineptness, making a mess of their apartment in the process.  When Daphne returns home, he realizes that she really loves him, and learns that she is innocent of Sweeneys charges: she had gone to Windborns room in search of her sister Barbara (Barbara Lawrence), Augusts wife, who was having an affair with Windborn, and became trapped there when she saw Sweeney spying on the room.  Alfred begs Daphnes forgiveness for his irrational behavior, which she gladly gives, ascribing it to the creative temperament of a great artist.  Erlewine, Stephen Thomas

* Overture to the opera Semiramide by Gioacchino Rossini, about a femme fatale as Alfred envisages his wife to be.
* Overture to the opera Tannhäuser (opera)|Tannhäuser und der Sängerkrieg auf Wartburg by Richard Wagner, about renunciation of carnal love for a higher and more spiritual goal, as Alfred sees himself in that situation. Francesca da Rimini by Peter Ilyich Tchaikovsky,  referring to the infernal destiny awaiting an adulterous wife, such as Dantes character.

==Production== Universal and Paramount who all rejected it during the 1930s. TCM    

In 1938, Sturges envisioned Ronald Colman playing de Carter, and later initially wanted Frances Ramsden &ndash; who was introduced in Sturges 1947 film The Sin of Harold Diddlebock &ndash; to play Daphne; but by the time casting for the film began, he wanted James Mason for the conductor and Gene Tierney for his wife. 
 Thomas Beecham, a chemist who invented Beechams Pills, a laxative.  It is speculated that Sturges named his character de Carter after Carters Little Liver Pills.) 

Unfaithfully Yours, which had the working titles of "Unfinished Symphony" and "The Symphony Story", went into production on February 18, 1948, and wrapped in mid April of that year. TCM     By 28 June the film had already been sneak-previewed, with a runtime of 127 minutes, but the films release was delayed to avoid any backlash from the suicide of actress Carole Landis in July.  It was rumored that Landis and Rex Harrison had been having an affair, and that she committed suicide when Harrison refused to get a divorce and marry her.  Harrison discovered Landis body in her home. 

The film premiered in New York City on November 5, 1948, and went into general release on December 10.   The Los Angeles premiere was on December 14.  It was marketed with the tagline: Will somebody "get her" tonite? 
 plagiarized from an unproduced screen story by Arthur Hoerl, which Shapiro had been intending to produce.  The connection was supposedly composer Werner Heymann, who frequently worked with Sturges and whom Shapiro had interviewed to be the music director on his film. 
 Horowitz and NBC Radio studios at Rockefeller Center. These rough cuts were later mastered into LPs which came to be considered classics. Arthur Rubinstein owned three of these devices. They were difficult to use and required experienced technicians.

==Reception==
While rich with the sharp dialogue that became Sturges trademark, the film was not a box office success. Critics usually attribute this to the darkness of the subject matter, especially for a comedy.  The idea of a bungling murderer did not sit well with 1948 audiences, and the fact that none of the characters are especially sympathetic certainly did not help. 

In 2008, director Quentin Tarantino placed the film at number 8 in his top 11 movies of all time. 

Sturges, whose previous film, The Sin of Harold Diddlebock had been pulled from distribution shortly after being released, never fully recovered from the lukewarm reception given to Unfaithfully Yours, and many point to it as the movie which effectively ended his career.  Despite this, it is considered today by many critics to be an outstanding film, as evidenced by a recent DVD release through the Criterion Collection. 

==Home media== The Criterion Company released a DVD of the film, featuring additional audio commentary by Sturges scholars James Harvey, Diane Jacobs, and Brian Henderson. 

==Remake== the same title, with Dudley Moore, Nastassja Kinski, Armand Assante and Albert Brooks and directed by Howard Zieff. The remake, however, eliminated the theme of three different pieces of music inspiring three different response or revenge scenarios.
